43,We have an outstanding program ahead. And so I just want to take a couple of minutes here at the outset.,00:11:08.910,00:11:02.430,Andrew Knight,41
44,To share with you how this program fits into some of the goals and the work that we're doing.,00:11:15.150,00:11:09.240,Andrew Knight,42
45,"for lifelong learning and so let me just share a couple of slides at the outset, before we welcome Professor liberty visitors who is going to be",00:11:24.180,00:11:15.480,Andrew Knight,43
46,Sharing her expertise and knowledge with us today. As you may or may not know Olin lifelong learning is an initiative.,00:11:33.450,00:11:24.600,Andrew Knight,44
47,That is specifically focused on providing opportunities for alumni to engage in continuous development and the rationale for this initiative.,00:11:42.990,00:11:33.930,Andrew Knight,45
48,Is very much the fact that we make a promise in our vision and our mission statement to provide a return on investment for alumni over the course of their entire careers. And so that's what we are.,00:11:57.030,00:11:43.530,Andrew Knight,46
49,"Working on with the Lifelong Learning Initiative, which is one quadrant of olins always Olin initiative.",00:12:04.590,00:11:57.360,Andrew Knight,47
50,As you've seen in some of the slides at the outset we are building currently,00:12:11.460,00:12:06.300,Andrew Knight,48
51,"And testing currently a platform that will support alumni learning in community. And so this is a platform that's going to be used to deliver content, similar to what we're going to experience today, but also other",00:12:25.650,00:12:12.060,Andrew Knight,49
52,"events that happen on campus, other kinds of thought leadership from our faculty as well as from alumni. And so this platform is going to be steadily rolling out in the weeks and months that come",00:12:38.850,00:12:26.010,Andrew Knight,50
53,You'll be able to find archived content things that have happened at the school in the past that we think are relevant.,00:12:44.430,00:12:39.390,Andrew Knight,51
54,And there will be opportunities for you to engage with your fellow alumni around some of those pieces of content so that you're sharing your expertise wisdom and insights with one another.,00:12:57.510,00:12:44.730,Andrew Knight,52
55,"Now as I mentioned at the start, we are so fortunate today to have with us. Professor liberty visitors.",00:13:05.250,00:12:57.960,Andrew Knight,53
56,Who is a Professor of Practice of data science here in the business school and she is someone who truly practices. What she preaches,00:13:14.520,00:13:05.670,Andrew Knight,54
57,She is active in disseminating her knowledge and expertise with respect to statistics data and analytics through so many different channels.,00:13:24.300,00:13:14.910,Andrew Knight,55
58,"Whether that is through the popular media where you might encounter some of her work and commentary, or through doing things like writing a book which is coming out here on the horizon.",00:13:36.420,00:13:24.690,Andrew Knight,56
59,"Just this month. And so we are so fortunate to have someone who is skilled and has deep expertise in this topic, and at the same time someone who is a skilled communicator about this topic. And so without further ado, please join me in welcoming Professor liberty that hurt.",00:13:55.740,00:13:36.840,Andrew Knight,57
60,"Hi, everybody. Thank you. I think I need to fire my PR person. And have you, Andrew. That was great. Um, does the screen. Look. Okay. Can you all see it.",00:14:05.850,00:13:57.180,Paul McCartney,58
61,"I think I hope I shared it right I'm learning zoom. Okay. Um, thank you all so much for having me here today I wanted to sort of",00:14:14.310,00:14:06.240,Paul McCartney,59
62,dive right in. I have these two graphs or two if you get bored listening to me talk,00:14:19.950,00:14:15.030,Paul McCartney,60
63,"But, um, you know, we've lived as humanists in our decision making for a very long time we go off our thoughts or opinions, our experience our gut and we are now living in this era of data ism.",00:14:32.610,00:14:20.280,Paul McCartney,61
64,"Where we have data drive our decisions, you know, from climate change to health care the refugee crisis. These all encompassing issues.",00:14:40.980,00:14:33.060,Paul McCartney,62
65,"But also in our everyday lives. You know, I don't go to the bookstore anymore. Amazon tells me what to read or dating apps tell you who you're compatible with",00:14:50.310,00:14:41.400,Paul McCartney,63
66,And I read an article like two or three days ago from new research that red wine is terrible for you and I swear. Two days later I read that red wine is wonderful for you and you should drink it.,00:15:01.800,00:14:50.700,Paul McCartney,64
67,"And it feels almost that humanism and data ism, or sort of pushing back against each other right now. Some people want to still go with that gut instinct and others want to have the drive are every decision.",00:15:13.890,00:15:02.340,Paul McCartney,65
68,But really the future is about bringing them together and that's what we're going to sort of touch on and have a taste of today is how we can get incredible ideas from data.,00:15:24.300,00:15:14.280,Paul McCartney,66
69,"But we also need to use that human touch. And I also want to say please use common questions, anything you want in the chat and makes it a lot more fun.",00:15:33.870,00:15:24.900,Paul McCartney,67
70,"Throughout the whole thing and I'll respond as we go. Um, so I want to start before we go into our many examples. And by the way, all these examples are short. So if one's boring. Just wait a couple minutes moving to a new one.",00:15:47.130,00:15:34.290,Paul McCartney,68
71,"Um, I wanted to visit with a French monk from the 17th century Blaise Pascal. You might also remember them from high school without Pascal's triangle so Pascal was a French monk who had a crisis of faith, but he decided to analyze his data.",00:16:05.160,00:15:47.700,Paul McCartney,69
72,"He felt that he had four scenarios. First, God doesn't exist, but he chooses to believe in God. He may live a wasted life with false belief, but when he dies, nothing happens.",00:16:20.550,00:16:06.330,Paul McCartney,70
73,"Now, he could not believe in God and God doesn't exist, and he may not have lived a wasted life of false belief, but again, when he dies, nothing happens.",00:16:30.990,00:16:21.300,Paul McCartney,71
74,"Now the third option God exists, and he believes in God, when he dies, he has the best case scenario heaven for him.",00:16:40.350,00:16:32.310,Paul McCartney,72
75,"But if God exists, and we don't believe in God. The fourth scenario, then it's eternal Hellfire really bad thing.",00:16:48.240,00:16:40.980,Paul McCartney,73
76,So what Pascal decided to do was to minimize the risk of the bad thing happening by believing in God and maximizing the potential is a good thing.,00:16:58.650,00:16:48.810,Paul McCartney,74
77,So he ruled out this possibility and left a 5050 chance of the best thing happening.,00:17:05.220,00:16:59.010,Paul McCartney,75
78,And that's really what data science is it's taking information from past and current events to predict the likelihood of a future event happening really the closest thing to a crystal ball. But the world has,00:17:19.260,00:17:05.820,Paul McCartney,76
79,The only difference between us and Pascal is we don't have four scenarios or four pieces of information we have endless amounts of data that is telling us what to do.,00:17:29.940,00:17:19.740,Paul McCartney,77
80,"And we also have something else. We're not sitting in a monastery, while we do this, we are having governments, businesses companies managers customers, clients even scientists, researchers",00:17:42.030,00:17:30.300,Paul McCartney,78
81,Trying to inform manipulate or persuade us using this data. So we need to be able to ask the right questions when data comes to us from a report or study or anything comes to us.,00:17:56.550,00:17:42.450,Paul McCartney,79
82,I want to discuss the questions that I ask every time I see one of these things. So we're going to have our for questions. And we're going to have examples of how if someone had just asked those questions.,00:18:08.640,00:17:56.880,Paul McCartney,80
83,"Everything would have been averted. The downside would have been minimized and the upside maximized. So let's start with our first question, who",00:18:17.190,00:18:08.910,Paul McCartney,81
84,"OJ Simpson, one of the most infamous criminal trials in American history to remind you. Oh Jay was an NFL superstar accused of murdering his ex WIFE NICOLE SIMPSON AND her lover Ronald while Goodman. I'm sure all of a lot of you remember the",00:18:33.810,00:18:18.720,Paul McCartney,82
85,"Case, and I'm sure a lot of you who are a little bit younger might remember one the Kardashian father is one of his lawyers, just to try to give some parallels there.",00:18:42.660,00:18:34.260,Paul McCartney,83
86,"Um, but, Alan Dershowitz whatever your personal feelings of him might be a fate is a famed legal mind in America, and he made a very interesting statistical argument during the trial.",00:18:54.630,00:18:43.290,Paul McCartney,84
87,He said that while it was known and definite that OJ beat Nicole absolutely no contest. So the fact that he physically abused her that it didn't matter.,00:19:04.980,00:18:55.110,Paul McCartney,85
88,"Because 4 million women in the United States are abused by their domestic partners, every year, but only one in 2500 of them are then murdered by their domestic partner. So the chance that OJ did it is one in 2500 and you can't convict someone on a one in 2500 chains.",00:19:23.190,00:19:05.610,Paul McCartney,86
89,"However, what the jury and most certainly the prosecution should have realized is that the statistic that Mr Dershowitz stated was completely irrelevant and here's why and Mr Dershowitz situation we have a living women who are currently domestic victims of domestic abuse.",00:19:43.830,00:19:24.360,Paul McCartney,87
90,"But at the time of the trial. NICOLE SIMPSON WAS NOT A living woman who's a victim of domestic abuse, whose chance of dying is one in 2500",00:19:54.090,00:19:44.850,Paul McCartney,88
91,But she's a murdered woman who was a victim of domestic abuse. We don't want to know the statistic about living women. We want to know the statistic about murdered women.,00:20:05.730,00:19:54.660,Paul McCartney,89
92,Who were victims of domestic abuse. And the question we want to know is that if you were a murdered woman.,00:20:12.510,00:20:06.120,Paul McCartney,90
93,"Who was a victim of domestic abuse, what is the chance that the guy who abused you murdered you versus being the victim of some random homicide.",00:20:23.400,00:20:13.230,Paul McCartney,91
94,"And in that case, the chance is nine and 10 so the chance that OJ killed Nicole was actually 90% not one in 2500",00:20:33.270,00:20:23.910,Paul McCartney,92
95,Though who we really wanted to know this statistic about changed everything.,00:20:39.210,00:20:33.900,Paul McCartney,93
96,"And it is so easy to miss the prosecution had their entire careers writing on this case, the whole world was watch it and they missed it.",00:20:48.930,00:20:39.720,Paul McCartney,94
97,This simple slip of the tongue of who we really want to know our data about living women who are victims murdered women who were changes everything. So that who question is integral whenever you get data.,00:21:01.890,00:20:49.560,Paul McCartney,95
98,Let's look at one more example of that Abraham Wald was a Jewish statistician who'd been locked out of the University positions and fled to the US before World War Two.,00:21:12.930,00:21:03.150,Paul McCartney,96
99,To avoid persecution and hungry.,00:21:15.360,00:21:13.500,Paul McCartney,97
100,"And he was recruited to help with the Allied cause and look at plane bombers that came back, he was told the analyze the bullet wounds on the plane bombers that came back.",00:21:25.350,00:21:16.170,Paul McCartney,98
101,"And decide which area of the plane that he should reinforce. So my question is, if you're Abraham walled, how do you decide by looking at these planes.",00:21:35.190,00:21:25.620,Paul McCartney,99
102,"What area, you should reinforce if you reinforce 10% of the plane.",00:21:39.510,00:21:35.550,Paul McCartney,100
103,"And he started with this data. This is the data. He had of all the planes that had come back bullet holes per square foot of the section of the plan. So just take one second, five seconds and think, where you would reinforce the plane. If you were Walt. Given this data.",00:21:57.210,00:21:40.080,Paul McCartney,101
104,Anyone is brave enough to put it into the chat. I'll be very impressed.,00:22:02.670,00:21:59.160,Paul McCartney,102
105,Real cockpit. Great.,00:22:06.060,00:22:04.590,Paul McCartney,103
106,Anywhere but we have everyone is too smart here.,00:22:10.320,00:22:07.440,Paul McCartney,104
107,Where the red dots are red gunner everyone is really smart here okay engines. So what most people think,00:22:20.100,00:22:12.780,Paul McCartney,105
108,"And what most people say is the area where there are the most bullets. Right. So the wings, the fuselage where the dots are the areas most bullets. That is what most people think and the most obvious answer.",00:22:31.290,00:22:20.460,Paul McCartney,106
109,What Walt is so famous for doing is saying that's actually not where we put it where we need to reinforce the planes or the undamaged parts and here's why.,00:22:43.950,00:22:31.740,Paul McCartney,107
110,"We have to who's we have planes that crashed abroad, the planes, the bombers that didn't make it back.",00:22:51.660,00:22:44.580,Paul McCartney,108
111,"And we have the planes that wall does able to see that we have did trivia. Trivia, I just saw this question in the chat, maybe lose my train of thought the trivia that came back. Now the planes that returned home.",00:23:03.330,00:22:52.020,Paul McCartney,109
112,"So we have two samples planes that crashed abroad planes that returned home, these are the ones come and see my cursor. I hope so. So I'm like pointing at the screen to which obviously you can see",00:23:12.510,00:23:03.660,Paul McCartney,110
113,"The planes that returned home, or what Walt was able to see and those planes when they got hit on the wings or the cockpit.",00:23:21.390,00:23:12.990,Paul McCartney,111
114,Right here. There's the cockpit. This is our engine when they got hit in the wings. They did their job. They made it back.,00:23:28.500,00:23:22.410,Paul McCartney,112
115,"They were not hit in the cockpit or the engine, the planes that crashed abroad, when they were hit in the cockpit or engine. They couldn't make it back.",00:23:38.340,00:23:29.430,Paul McCartney,113
116,"So, those who were looking at, or sometimes ones we can't even see and it gives us a whole nother answer of where we should be reinforcing the planes, so that both groups, both samples are able to make it back.",00:23:51.720,00:23:38.940,Paul McCartney,114
117,"So this brings us to our second question we have our first have who is the data really about, who do we want to know this data about and next",00:24:01.950,00:23:54.000,Paul McCartney,115
118,"Is what exactly are we, why are we prone to making this type of mistake error. Very good question. Andrew",00:24:07.980,00:24:02.190,Paul McCartney,116
119,"Part of what happens when we're trying to think about these things is we miss the simple answer right. Where's look so focused on looking at the data, the planes that made it back.",00:24:17.370,00:24:08.460,Paul McCartney,117
120,"That we don't take a step back and say, Who is it that we really care about. We don't really care about the planes that made it back, right, because they made it back. They did their job.",00:24:26.400,00:24:17.640,Paul McCartney,118
121,"We actually care about the who didn't make it back. So it's, it's all about taking one step back from the data and asking these actually very broad stroke questions.",00:24:37.260,00:24:26.640,Paul McCartney,119
122,"So our second question is, what what is, what is it that we really want to know if our data.",00:24:43.350,00:24:38.340,Paul McCartney,120
123,"Uber, there was an Uber ban in London Transport for London office. The authorizing authority for all taxis in London band Uber.",00:24:52.170,00:24:44.010,Paul McCartney,121
124,"Now, there's a lot of questions about why exactly they did it. But why they said they did it. Is that Uber was dangerous Uber had become associated with sexual assaults. I remember I was in London.",00:25:03.180,00:24:52.530,Paul McCartney,122
125,"I was getting an Uber. I was on the phone with my father and I said, Dad. I'll call you back. And he said, No, no, no. Liberty. Where are you, I said, I'm getting into Uber. He goes no, I've heard those are so dangerous in London. You can't get into what",00:25:13.920,00:25:03.480,Paul McCartney,123
126,"It's like 4pm on a Tuesday. But anyway, the public believed that Uber was dangerous the public truly believed it. So how, how did the public come to believe that Uber was dangerous.",00:25:25.740,00:25:14.130,Paul McCartney,124
127,"Well, the London taxi drivers Association, which is what you think of when you think of a black cab in London. They put up an advertisement.",00:25:33.900,00:25:26.160,Paul McCartney,125
128,Last year there are 154 rapes and sexual assaults by many cab drivers in London at least 32 of these Uber drivers.,00:25:42.330,00:25:34.620,Paul McCartney,126
129,There's also an image of a girl her makeup is streaming down her face. She is clearly just been sexually assaulted.,00:25:48.240,00:25:42.600,Paul McCartney,127
130,I just wanted to go home. Don't take a risk with a mini cap that's an incredibly powerful advertisement. And if you notice the Metropolitan Police. The London Police logo.,00:25:59.970,00:25:48.570,Paul McCartney,128
131,And the Transport for London office logo are both at the bottom of this ad incredibly powerful.,00:26:05.640,00:26:00.210,Paul McCartney,129
132,"And just do us a little bit of vocab when they say taxis taxis are black cabs, which are what you think of when you think of a London cab and mini caps that's any other type of private car transportation",00:26:16.740,00:26:05.880,Paul McCartney,130
133,"Uber's included so when they say 154 rapes and sexual assaults by mini cab drivers in London, they mean everything but blackcaps",00:26:24.630,00:26:17.370,Paul McCartney,131
134,Very powerful advertisement. The problem is that it wasn't true.,00:26:28.560,00:26:25.080,Paul McCartney,132
135,"What the freedom of information request act actually said is that there were 154 allegations of rape or sexual assault, where the suspect was alleged to be a taxi driver that includes blackcaps 32 of these or by an Uber driver.",00:26:42.660,00:26:29.130,Paul McCartney,133
136,"So clearly the black cab Association had taken themselves out of this when they were asked about this. They said, oops, sorry clerical error.",00:26:53.430,00:26:43.920,Paul McCartney,134
137,"Oh, we'll take it down and they did and they put up another one last year there 32 allegations of rape or sexual assault made against Uber drivers, the same image of the girl her makeup streaming down her face. She has clearly just been sexually assaulted. I just wanted to go home.",00:27:10.500,00:26:54.210,Paul McCartney,135
138,"Why up your risk with a mini cab. Now, it's true. The information is true. But, what question do we really want to know of our data.",00:27:19.770,00:27:11.970,Paul McCartney,136
139,Do you really up your risk. So let's take a look at the very simple numbers. We were given the wrong number of salts 32 by Uber drivers 154 total,00:27:31.380,00:27:21.030,Paul McCartney,137
140,But is that really what we want to know of our numbers. Is that really what we want to know of our data.,00:27:36.600,00:27:31.650,Paul McCartney,138
141,"If Uber was responsible for 32 sexual assaults, but only did 32 journeys, the entire year in London, they would be very dangerous. There's 100% chance you'll be sexually assaulted. If you get an Uber.",00:27:48.540,00:27:37.110,Paul McCartney,139
142,What if they did millions of journeys. What if they did many more than all of the others. So let's take a look.,00:27:54.660,00:27:48.900,Paul McCartney,140
143,Proportion of sexual assaults by Uber drivers 32 by Uber 154 total. So they are Uber's responsible for 20% of a sexual assaults in London.,00:28:04.830,00:27:55.020,Paul McCartney,141
144,"But how many journeys are they responsible for number of journeys in London and any kind of taxi, including Uber's 3,000,001 million of those are completed by Uber.",00:28:15.600,00:28:05.340,Paul McCartney,142
145,"So Uber is responsible for 33% of the journeys, but only 20% of the sexual assaults, meaning that Uber is actually a safer way to get around than any other type of tax.",00:28:31.740,00:28:16.020,Paul McCartney,143
146,"And what about these headlines, the number of cab drivers charged with violence or sexual offenses in London. Is it a five year high",00:28:39.300,00:28:32.640,Paul McCartney,144
147,Trying to say that with the introduction of Uber London has taxis have gotten much less safe well in 2015 there 136 reports of rape or sexual assault by taxis. When this headline was written.,00:28:51.060,00:28:39.570,Paul McCartney,145
148,"And what is the definition of a five year high, it means it was just as high five years ago in 2009 three years before Uber even started there 136 reports of rape or sexual assault by taxi drivers Uber had nothing to do with making it more unsafe.",00:29:07.200,00:28:51.480,Paul McCartney,146
149,Now this seems like an unfortunate situation for Uber. But there's more to it. There's 3.5 million customers who last and arguably better product.,00:29:15.090,00:29:07.740,Paul McCartney,147
150,"40,000 jobs are potentially lost from this and most Uber drivers and lease or contract higher their cars and then obviously the revenue for Uber in London.",00:29:24.600,00:29:15.480,Paul McCartney,148
151,"So what we really want to know of our data, the raw numbers. The proportions, the relative proportions changes the entire analysis.",00:29:33.660,00:29:24.930,Paul McCartney,149
152,So now we'll do one more example of what that's a little bit lighter and my mother. My mother was very excited when she saw these headlines.,00:29:41.910,00:29:34.650,Paul McCartney,150
153,"Chocolate can stave off all simers as cocoa, the brain drug of the future chocolate improves brain function. This is about a year and a half ago, my mother was ecstatic. She called me. She said, liberty, I told you so.",00:29:53.850,00:29:42.210,Paul McCartney,151
154,This is amazing. And she asked me the question that we probably wanted to ask of the data. How much chocolate. Can you look back at the study liberty. How much chocolate. Can I actually get to eat.,00:30:08.910,00:29:54.720,Paul McCartney,152
155,"In order to potentially reduce my risk. So that was the question she asked, and that is what we want to know. Right. How much chocolate. Do I get to eat to potentially reduce my risk.",00:30:21.510,00:30:09.810,Paul McCartney,153
156,"Well, it's obviously not chocolate. That's what reduces our risk. It's a bioactive called flavanols and flavanols are in chocolate. They're also in red wine.",00:30:30.930,00:30:21.960,Paul McCartney,154
157,"And so the question really is, is how many flavanols. Do I have to eat every day. And that's 510 milligrams. So unless you're going to take a five and all pill. You want to know how many flavanols are in chocolate.",00:30:43.230,00:30:31.620,Paul McCartney,155
158,"So let's say you, um, you're not really a chocolate person, but you might drink, eat some cocoa powder, you know, put it in, mix it into water a little hot chocolate.",00:30:52.050,00:30:43.890,Paul McCartney,156
159,And you'd have to have 20 cups of hot chocolate every day in order to potentially reduce your risk.,00:30:58.470,00:30:52.500,Paul McCartney,157
160,If you don't like hot chocolate and your dark chocolate person you'd have to have 1600 calories of dark chocolate every day.,00:31:05.730,00:30:58.710,Paul McCartney,158
161,And if you're like me and you like milk chocolate. That's 3900 calories every day of milk chocolate.,00:31:12.810,00:31:06.030,Paul McCartney,159
162,"In order to potentially reduce your risk. Now, I'm not saying I couldn't do that. Okay, but I am saying that I would die of something else, way before I had to worry about getting Alzheimer's or dementia.",00:31:24.750,00:31:13.050,Paul McCartney,160
163,"And yes, this as well as the previous example, I'm looking at the chat does have enormous really really fascinating correlations to health care and we're actually going to do one of those examples. Next, especially with Kobe that I think should be interesting for everyone to see.",00:31:41.790,00:31:25.530,Paul McCartney,161
164,"So the question of what we really want to know what we care about death by chocolate yes 3900 calories a day. I think we could do it for a little while, but it may not be great.",00:31:51.840,00:31:42.960,Paul McCartney,162
165,"And I also I, you know, when I was looking back at this study from my mom, I thought, you know, I wonder who funded",00:31:57.720,00:31:52.110,Paul McCartney,163
166,"This study who wanted us to think that chocolate was so great for us. And it's amazing that Mars center for cocoa health science was in charge of the research for this one. They just, you know, so kind of them to want us to, you know, have their products do good for us very frightened.",00:32:12.810,00:31:58.110,Paul McCartney,164
167,"So we get to our third question we have, who is the data. What do we really want to know, and we get to how is it interpreted",00:32:21.870,00:32:14.400,Paul McCartney,165
168,"So french fries. I like chocolate. But I like French fries, a lot better and I saw this this headline come out eight year study",00:32:29.550,00:32:22.170,Paul McCartney,166
169,Finds heavy french fry eaters have double the chance of death could french fries be killing you french fries are killing you.,00:32:37.830,00:32:29.790,Paul McCartney,167
170,This is true. According to a peer reviewed study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and what the journal actually said,00:32:46.410,00:32:38.130,Paul McCartney,168
171,"Is that if you eat any form of fried potato more than twice a week, which means three times per week or more you double your risk of death.",00:32:54.270,00:32:47.070,Paul McCartney,169
172,"And it's true. That is what the journal said, and I went back to the study. So let's, let's start with our questions who well in the study. The average person was a 60 YEAR OLD MAN Okay.",00:33:06.450,00:32:54.660,Paul McCartney,170
173,"And what we really want to know is, we want to know what the differences for risk of death of a 60 year old man, if you eat no potatoes. No french fries versus if you do",00:33:17.670,00:33:07.170,Paul McCartney,171
174,"And that is doubling your risk of death. So our COO and our what makes sense. The question is, is how is it interpreted. So let's look at it a little bit of a different way than doubling your risk of death.",00:33:29.280,00:33:18.030,Paul McCartney,172
175,"If you're a 60 year old man, your risk of death at any point in time, regardless of how much you eat.",00:33:35.220,00:33:29.820,Paul McCartney,173
176,"Is 1% meaning that if I line up 160 year old men. One of them will die in the next year, just by virtue of the fact that they're 60 and their male sorry 60 year old man apologize but it's going to be better at the end.",00:33:47.820,00:33:35.880,Paul McCartney,174
177,"Now, if these 100 men eat french fries three times per week or more for their entire lives instead of one of them dying.",00:34:02.190,00:33:48.570,Paul McCartney,175
178,"To will we double our risk of death instead of one, two, which is still bad. Okay, but it sounds a whole lot better to go from a 1% to a 2% then doubling your risk of death.",00:34:15.390,00:34:03.180,Paul McCartney,176
179,"And I also, you know, I don't know about you guys, but when I eat french",00:34:19.260,00:34:16.320,Paul McCartney,177
180,"Like I eat french fries. I love them, but I don't really just eat french fries. Right. I have like a couple of beers. I have a big old juicy cheeseburger right there with me.",00:34:28.950,00:34:19.530,Paul McCartney,178
181,"And you know if I'm eating french fries three times per week or more, I'm not sure I'm like eating perfectly healthy. The rest of the time. Okay.",00:34:36.390,00:34:29.250,Paul McCartney,179
182,I may not exactly be you know out there running five miles per day. If I'm eating french fries three times per week or more. So could it potentially be something else that has an effect on this.,00:34:46.290,00:34:36.570,Paul McCartney,180
183,"So that how we interpret, whether it's double risk of death or one in 100 to two and 100 and these dudes get to eat french fries. All time",00:34:54.960,00:34:47.220,Paul McCartney,181
184,changes how we see this data. Let's look at another example. And this brings us to the covert testing that we were discussing here earlier.,00:35:03.360,00:34:55.500,Paul McCartney,182
185,"And yes, it is too bad that we can't rely on news outlets, you really have to think about these things and ask these questions yourself, which is very, very difficult.",00:35:12.210,00:35:03.690,Paul McCartney,183
186,"Okay, I have the antibodies. So it's safe. If we hang out. We now have an antibody test for coven",00:35:19.230,00:35:12.960,Paul McCartney,184
187,Meaning that if you've had coven you take the antibody test. If you have the antibodies. The idea is that you are then immune from coven and you also cannot pass it on to other people.,00:35:28.290,00:35:19.470,Paul McCartney,185
188,For the purposes of this will assume that's true that if you have antibodies. You can you assume that you're immune and you cannot pass it on to other people.,00:35:36.930,00:35:28.800,Paul McCartney,186
189,"And I've had people say this to me. I've had friends say this to me. I have the antibodies. So it's safe. We can hang out. You can be around me and then go be around your elderly parents, no problem.",00:35:46.920,00:35:37.290,Paul McCartney,187
190,"So the question is, is that true, how good is the testing. So the CDC put out guidance to the general public about these antibody tests. They said, and a population or the prevalence is 5% a test with 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity will yield the positive predictive value of 49%",00:36:05.220,00:35:47.550,Paul McCartney,188
191,"Sorry. You think the general person that's taking an antibody test has any idea what that means include. I mean, it takes me and this is what I do for a living. And it takes me a while to sit down there and puzzle out what this means.",00:36:18.090,00:36:06.270,Paul McCartney,189
192,"How are people supposed to really understand this. Yes, this is definitely where the headache comes on. Thank you.",00:36:23.670,00:36:18.660,Paul McCartney,190
193,So let's take a step back and think about what question we really want to know the first test approved by the FDA for coven 19 antibody testing as sent on the CDC website is 95% accurate.,00:36:38.220,00:36:24.360,Paul McCartney,191
194,"What we want to know is what is the chance if your friend comes to you and says, I have the antibodies, it's safe to hang out.",00:36:44.490,00:36:38.790,Paul McCartney,192
195,"What you want to know is what is the chance that an individual actually has the antibodies, assuming they test positive",00:36:52.470,00:36:44.910,Paul McCartney,193
196,Most people would assume based upon the CDC website is that it's 95% the test is 95% accurate. So there's a 95% chance that they have the antibodies and then it's fine.,00:37:02.580,00:36:53.130,Paul McCartney,194
197,Let's take a closer look. If you have an antibody test. There are four possible outcomes outcome. One is you are positive and you test positive the test did its job. You're all good.,00:37:16.080,00:37:03.690,Paul McCartney,195
198,Outcome to is that you are negative for antibodies and you test negative again the test did its job.,00:37:22.800,00:37:16.710,Paul McCartney,196
199,But because the test is not 100% accurate. There are two other possible outcomes. The first is a false negative,00:37:31.650,00:37:23.340,Paul McCartney,197
200,That means the test says you don't have the antibodies test negative. But you do have them the falls apart.,00:37:38.730,00:37:32.070,Paul McCartney,198
201,"Now, that one's not that dangerous, right. It's kind of annoying because you wish you knew that you had the antibodies and you can go out and do stuff.",00:37:45.360,00:37:39.390,Paul McCartney,199
202,"But you're not going to pass the disease on to, and you're going to pass the virus on to anyone else because you're going to think that you don't have the end the body. So you need to stay home.",00:37:53.400,00:37:45.600,Paul McCartney,200
203,"But there's a fourth option, a false positive, the test says you have the antibodies, but you don't",00:38:00.540,00:37:54.180,Paul McCartney,201
204,"And this is the really dangerous one. Because you're going to think that you're going to your immune, you're going to think you can't pass it on to anyone else. And you're going to go out into the wide world and pass it on.",00:38:10.230,00:38:00.990,Paul McCartney,202
205,"So the question is, how often does this happen. So let's let's look. Let's take a real scenario.",00:38:18.270,00:38:11.520,Paul McCartney,203
206,"5% of the population has coded 19 that's what the CDC meant when they said 5% prevalence, meaning that they 5% is had it and we'll test positive for it.",00:38:28.170,00:38:18.690,Paul McCartney,204
207,And the coven 19 antibody test is 95% accurate. So those are two assumptions and starting points. So let's say we have a population of thousand people. Let's say it's 1000 people at work.,00:38:39.150,00:38:28.710,Paul McCartney,205
208,So if there's 5% prevalence in the population 5% of these people have had coven and will test positive for it 5% of 1000 is 50 people so 50 people have antibodies and we'll test positive for tested its job.,00:38:54.150,00:38:40.020,Paul McCartney,206
209,"But the test is only 95% accurate meaning 5% of the time, it won't be accurate.",00:39:00.360,00:38:55.050,Paul McCartney,207
210,"So we will have a 5% false positive rate, people will falsely test positive, it will tell them that they have the antibodies, but they don't 5% of 1000 is again 50 so we have 50 people who will falsely test positive",00:39:15.930,00:39:00.840,Paul McCartney,208
211,"Now out of our thousand people all 100 of these people will test positive all 100 old test positive, but only 50 of them actually have it.",00:39:29.280,00:39:16.890,Paul McCartney,209
212,"Meaning there's only a 50% chance that you actually have the antibodies. So back to our original question of what is the chance to be an individual actually has the antibodies, assuming they test positive",00:39:42.240,00:39:30.060,Paul McCartney,210
213,50%. That's it. It's the same as a toss of a coin. So when we think that if we have the antibodies. We can go back out into the world.,00:39:51.210,00:39:43.230,Paul McCartney,211
214,"There's a 5050 chance that it won't work. Yes. Not all 1000 people get the test that is true, but we're going, we're basing this idea of antibody testing on that it will help us get back to work.",00:40:02.160,00:39:51.750,Paul McCartney,212
215,"And so we would test everyone in the population and how it, but people who test negative impact this style at all in general that number for this 95% accurate what they meant was 5% false positives and 5% false negatives. So there would also be a large issue with that as well.",00:40:19.710,00:40:02.580,Paul McCartney,213
216,Okey dokey.,00:40:22.680,00:40:21.870,Paul McCartney,214
217,"So, how we interpret the data, you know, CDC put out that statement, but how we interpret it as 95% accurate versus actually 5050 changes the entire way that we look at the situation.",00:40:35.310,00:40:24.750,Paul McCartney,215
218,So now we get to our final example of how and my favorite one finished baby boxes in 2013 the BBC put out this article Why finished babies sleep in cardboard boxes.,00:40:47.280,00:40:36.600,Paul McCartney,216
219,It was an article documenting the finished policy of giving every mother a cardboard box baby supplies and the baby would use the box as a bed.,00:40:56.430,00:40:47.760,Paul McCartney,217
220,"And this is a really interesting example of what happened because it exploded all over the place. People were talking about these baby boxes and for me, when my Molly, I will be right back to you. I'm going to write outside talk about that at the end.",00:41:10.020,00:40:57.300,Paul McCartney,218
221,But inside this article was a graph and it showed Finland's incredible decrease in infant mortality rate incredible progress from 1935 down here to 2010,00:41:23.460,00:41:11.790,Paul McCartney,219
222,"And it also included Finland's and current infant mortality rate which is two and 1000 versus the rest of the world, which is 32 and 1000",00:41:31.860,00:41:23.910,Paul McCartney,220
223,So really incredible based upon this policy of sending every mother a baby box.,00:41:38.100,00:41:32.340,Paul McCartney,221
224,"And it sparked an entire industry finished baby boxes British baby boxes. I actually went to a shower recently and the girl, my friend who was having a baby got two baby boxes at this whole industry.",00:41:51.930,00:41:38.730,Paul McCartney,222
225,And it's incredible really this box this cardboard box that can save a baby's life. It's not just any cardboard box. It's an $850 cardboard box.,00:42:01.980,00:41:52.380,Paul McCartney,223
226,"I'm not really sure what they print on that thing. But inside of it actually looks got one to look at it and I'm inside. It has six diapers, which I'm I think any parents would be able to decide how long six diapers last",00:42:14.130,00:42:02.610,Paul McCartney,224
227,"Like two one Z's. A couple books. So really, the, the whole thing is this cardboard box.",00:42:19.410,00:42:14.700,Paul McCartney,225
228,"Is your baby slept one baby slept in a dresser drawer exactly same concept but you know i i would admit I hope the dresser Jordan cost 800 bucks, but you never know.",00:42:28.830,00:42:20.760,Paul McCartney,226
229,"And so, but, you know, okay, if we really believed that this box would save your child's life would save any child's life, you'd say fine 800 bucks. No problem. You would do anything to get that box anything. So the question is, does it",00:42:46.680,00:42:29.670,Paul McCartney,227
230,Let's take a look back at this exact same graph and how we're going to interpret this data and how we're going to interpret this graph.,00:42:55.350,00:42:47.970,Paul McCartney,228
231,"In 1938 Finland had a higher infant mortality profile, then it's other Nordic neighbors and it decided it needed to do something about it.",00:43:04.290,00:42:55.890,Paul McCartney,229
232,"So it went on this incredible marketing campaign convincing others rich, poor educated or uneducated that they if they had their kids sleeping this baby box back kids slept in it they be fine. They'd survive, but this would save their child's life.",00:43:23.040,00:43:04.680,Paul McCartney,230
233,"And when every mother was convinced of this and wanted this baby box. The finished government said, you know, there's actually a catch.",00:43:33.300,00:43:24.300,Paul McCartney,231
234,"In order to get this baby box every mother will get one, but you have to go to prenatal education class.",00:43:41.190,00:43:33.990,Paul McCartney,232
235,So in 1944 the year before the box came out 31% finished and others receive Prenatal Education in 1945 the year after 86% of finished mothers received Prenatal Education. It wasn't the box at all. It was education and general progress of info mortality rates across the world.,00:44:02.010,00:43:42.090,Paul McCartney,233
236,"And the reason we know this is because the infant mortality profile for rich, poor educated and uneducated finished mothers.",00:44:09.630,00:44:03.090,Paul McCartney,234
237,"Is the same as the infant mortality profile for rich and educated mothers in the US, the difference is born on educated mothers in the US have a much higher infant mortality profile. Now you can forgive industry for",00:44:24.420,00:44:09.900,Paul McCartney,235
238,"You know, deciding to profit and go, go forth and conquer off of these finished baby boxes.",00:44:30.330,00:44:25.440,Paul McCartney,236
239,But you would think governments and other governments would sort of look into this sort of how this these baby boxes really worked before embarking upon a scheme.,00:44:40.290,00:44:31.170,Paul McCartney,237
240,To send out baby boxes but no in a baby boxes were sent out in Essex in Birmingham and Scotland. They piloted a program in 2016 and now every single mother and Scotland receives a baby box. No. Prenatal Education required to the tune of I think $13 million of taxpayer money.,00:44:59.820,00:44:40.590,Paul McCartney,238
241,"But you know, that's the UK. We're America or smarter our government would definitely look into this stuff before piloting these baby boxes.",00:45:07.800,00:45:01.020,Paul McCartney,239
242,"Except they don't US states introduced baby boxes to help combat infant mortality in 2017 Alabama New Jersey and Ohio sent out baby boxes to the tune of 15,000,020 6,000,030 $5 million tons and tons of taxpayer money wasted with no Prenatal Education required",00:45:30.630,00:45:08.160,Paul McCartney,240
243,"And if someone had simply asked how is this interpreted. How does, what does this graph really mean we wouldn't be here.",00:45:40.050,00:45:32.160,Paul McCartney,241
244,"And as Alonso asks, How do you get to think to all the questions that are not intuitive to the data presented",00:45:46.470,00:45:40.530,Paul McCartney,242
245,"I know these questions seems stupid who what and how but I am telling you they work if you just take a step back and think, Who is this data about",00:45:57.210,00:45:46.950,Paul McCartney,243
246,"What are we really trying to ask of it and how should we really be interpreting this, it may not give you the answers. It may not make us. It's not going to make you a statistician",00:46:07.650,00:45:57.540,Paul McCartney,244
247,But it will give you a feeling for whether the veracity of this data really need something,00:46:12.990,00:46:07.980,Paul McCartney,245
248,"And this this example leads us to our fourth question of why, why do we care and I want to, I want to use the same baby box numbers. And I want to say, you know,",00:46:24.870,00:46:13.860,Paul McCartney,246
249,"I don't know the difference between 26,000,035 million except that it's 9 million",00:46:29.640,00:46:25.350,Paul McCartney,247
250,"These numbers don't mean anything to me and our jobs and our work and newspapers, we see these numbers. Every time we see billions. We see trillions.",00:46:37.680,00:46:29.940,Paul McCartney,248
251,"For a lot of states 15,000,035. These are rounding errors for states for companies. How do we have a we make these numbers mean something. Why should we care about this money that's lost",00:46:50.130,00:46:37.890,Paul McCartney,249
252,And I would say that going along the lines of anyone looking at this would be interested in sort of Child Health and baby health that we somehow figure out a way to make those numbers mean something in terms of that in terms of their opportunity cost as Mandy says,00:47:04.800,00:46:51.030,Paul McCartney,250
253,"So how do we do that, I would say, then instead of saying that Alabama wasted $15 million of taxpayer money.",00:47:12.210,00:47:05.340,Paul McCartney,251
254,"They could have paid for diapers for a year for 30,000 babies or New Jersey could have bought baby food for a year for 40,000 babies or Ohio could have paid a year salary for 800 new child social care workers.",00:47:29.580,00:47:12.600,Paul McCartney,252
255,We need to turn these numbers into something that matters to people into something that people understand and personally matters to them.,00:47:39.180,00:47:29.880,Paul McCartney,253
256,And that brings me to our last example you know we've talked this whole time about negative things you know the right you know,00:47:46.860,00:47:40.110,Paul McCartney,254
257,"About the, you know, all the manipulative things bad things sneaky things. But there's also incredible things that we can do. There's really incredible things we can do with actually making people care about the numbers.",00:48:00.000,00:47:47.130,Paul McCartney,255
258,"Or in the most severe refugee crisis since world war two and it's only growing UNHCR, the UN Refugee agencies budget for 2016 was $8",00:48:09.240,00:48:00.810,Paul McCartney,256
259,"Billion, but they only got 3 billion. That's $5 billion needed to help people. So what do they do they need to figure out a way to raise more money.",00:48:18.090,00:48:09.690,Paul McCartney,257
260,"That is, but as what needs to be done for this refugee crisis. So how do they do it, and I'm going to show you a very disturbing image. Next, so please. Just be ready for that.",00:48:27.030,00:48:18.540,Paul McCartney,258
261,This is Alan Curtis. He's a three year old Syrian boy who in 2015 was found drowned on a Turkish beach and his family were Syrian refugees fleeing to Europe.,00:48:37.920,00:48:28.560,Paul McCartney,259
262,"This pictures unfathomably horrible event is really what sparked the world's discussion of the Syrian refugee crisis and one would imagine. I mean, how could you not look at that photo and feel sort of a deep on unbelievable sadness and it did increase donations, but not for very long.",00:48:59.640,00:48:38.550,Paul McCartney,260
263,"Three days was how long this image stayed in people's minds. There's absolutely horrible, horrible tragedy, and it was three days that a picture was able to see stay in people's minds.",00:49:12.330,00:49:00.840,Paul McCartney,261
264,"So we decided that we need to figure out what does stay in people's minds what works, what makes them care about the crisis or the issue longer",00:49:22.110,00:49:12.780,Paul McCartney,262
265,"So we did a study and what works and what doesn't. So we call people and we ask them questions and you say, which one of these does this increase or decrease your affinity towards the crisis.",00:49:35.160,00:49:22.920,Paul McCartney,263
266,"So if someone asks you, refugees undergo stringent security checks. Would that make you feel better about refugees or worse and take a second and think what you think most people would feel",00:49:45.390,00:49:35.760,Paul McCartney,264
267,"This question surprised me. It actually decreased people's affinity for the cause, because it reminded them that there are security issues.",00:49:55.260,00:49:47.700,Paul McCartney,265
268,Refugees more likely to graduate college and secure jobs than non refugees.,00:50:01.080,00:49:56.310,Paul McCartney,266
269,Is that going to increase or decrease people support in this case that decreased Democratic support but increased Republican support.,00:50:09.390,00:50:02.220,Paul McCartney,267
270,Nearly half of refugees or children.,00:50:12.450,00:50:10.530,Paul McCartney,268
271,Increased all support Albert Einstein was a refugee think it increased or decreased support it increased all support. We did a test on Catholics.,00:50:23.610,00:50:13.650,Paul McCartney,269
272,"60 million to displace 21 million refugees are fleeing their homes and then we had another one that said, Jesus was a refugee, the numbers had no change in support. Jesus was a refugee had an large increase",00:50:37.980,00:50:24.240,Paul McCartney,270
273,What this told us is that if you say there is a global refugee crisis. They're 16 million displaced. No one cares right these are fleeting numbers. They mean nothing to us and it goes right out of our head.,00:50:50.760,00:50:38.430,Paul McCartney,271
274,"But if we can take the numbers and have them say this is the way it impacts you and what you care about people will become donors, people are affected, and they will remember",00:51:02.250,00:50:51.390,Paul McCartney,272
275,"So we did a campaign during the major league baseball playoffs for each team that you would be watching, we put up their stadium and the number of people.",00:51:11.820,00:51:03.450,Paul McCartney,273
276,"42,000 new people flee their homes on a daily basis. This is the same size as the crowd that you are watching on TV and this case at the Minute Maid Park, home of the Houston Astros",00:51:23.820,00:51:12.060,Paul McCartney,274
277,"It let us take this big number 42,000 people flee their home every day. That means nothing to anyone.",00:51:31.050,00:51:24.450,Paul McCartney,275
278,"And give it a visual from something that people care about, they are watching this stadium, they are watching this crowd. They can see all these people",00:51:41.040,00:51:31.680,Paul McCartney,276
279,"And it meant something it increase donations by 100,000 recurring donors. People, who keep giving",00:51:49.590,00:51:41.550,Paul McCartney,277
280,"If you are able to tell good numerical stories. If you're able to not just take the data analysis, but actually show the why, why we should care about it and make it mean something to people.",00:52:03.900,00:51:50.580,Paul McCartney,278
281,"Then, whether it's for engagement action donation customers whatever you're trying to do. If those numbers can impact someone personally, you can have a lasting decision for them.",00:52:16.320,00:52:04.200,Paul McCartney,279
282,"Really overall what this says is, we come back to data ism and humanism, you know, data gives us incredible insights to things. We'd never be able to see, but we need to retain our own experience and our own tuition.",00:52:33.090,00:52:19.770,Paul McCartney,280
283,"And make sure that we were always asking the right questions of the data. The who the what the how and the, why should we care. And if we're able to do that then we really can deliver true value in both our personal and working moms. Thank you.",00:52:49.770,00:52:33.390,Paul McCartney,281
284,"Thank you very much liberty for sharing such a helpful way of thinking about numbers and I was wondering, in a couple minutes that we have. If you have any",00:53:02.130,00:52:52.410,Andrew Knight,282
285,"Like rules of thumb or your risks that you use when you're reading a news article or, you know, the latest piece of information that comes out about coven. Is there anything that that you do consciously to try to make your way through some of the distortion of numbers.",00:53:20.430,00:53:02.670,Andrew Knight,283
286,"I think the first and most important thing is to not believe any of it right off the bat, and I hate saying that because you don't want to be this.",00:53:28.830,00:53:21.450,Paul McCartney,284
287,"You know, sort of non believer, but you really can't believe it right off the bat, the biggest numbers. The 95% accurate or the double the risk of death. That's what makes you read the article.",00:53:40.350,00:53:29.100,Paul McCartney,285
288,"I will say, I think the headlines are almost always way worse than the article itself. A lot of times the article itself will have the caveats, and will have the the world. Well, if you look at it this way, the headlines never will.",00:53:54.510,00:53:40.620,Paul McCartney,286
289,"Because the headlines are really about getting people to read it. And in general, like I know for example. Whenever I write, I don't get to choose the headline. I have zero SEO for it.",00:54:03.240,00:53:55.020,Paul McCartney,287
290,"And it will be what is going to get people to read it and it's not going to have the well it's not a double a risk of death of you dying from French fries. It's actually you know headline. Oh, a 1% increase in risk of death. It just doesn't get you to read it.",00:54:16.380,00:54:03.600,Paul McCartney,288
291,"So it just takes like scrutinizing i mean i think i dropped something in the chat earlier that, you know, it gives me a headache sometimes to try to make my way through, what is the actual",00:54:29.100,00:54:18.180,Andrew Knight,289
292,risk level that's being presented and of course the always important question that john has dropped in the in the chat to leave us with and maybe you could leave this as a cliffhanger. How do we win the lottery.,00:54:43.470,00:54:30.090,Andrew Knight,290
293,Got to buy the book.,00:54:44.760,00:54:43.830,Paul McCartney,291

295,"Book. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.",00:54:47.310,00:54:46.200,Paul McCartney,293
296,"I actually deleted that example because I was running out of time. Get Away With Murder, you gotta go look at OJ it and it worked out. Sure. You really want to try that. But there's, there's a lot of questions about statistical change of samples.",00:55:02.100,00:54:48.900,Paul McCartney,294
297,"Well, thank you again so much for taking time to share these thoughts with us. And folks, if you can go down to the bottom of your zoom window, you'll see a",00:55:12.000,00:55:03.360,Andrew Knight,295
298,"button that says reactions. And so if you'd click that reactions button and let's give liberty, a virtual you know Round of applause for sharing her expertise with us.",00:55:25.380,00:55:12.480,Andrew Knight,296
299,"Certainly, if you are in person ensure we have here rockets. APPLAUSE So thank you so much everyone, hope you have a wonderful rest of your day and 15 minutes if this is your lunch hour to squeeze out and grab something to eat. So thanks everyone.

314,Whatever you whatever is easiest for you.,00:00:55.740,00:00:53.760,John Lennon,312
315,So pop up screen that I saw why I said I liked the pop up screen that I saw before I got in. I had seen that before.,00:01:04.200,00:00:56.820,John Lennon,313

319,So we will. I'll do just a brief.,00:01:18.300,00:01:15.270,Andrew Knight,317

So I'll just do a brief very brief intro before I intro you throw it over to you and you can share your screen then and and dive in. Awesome. Thanks. Okay.,00:01:36.570,00:01:19.560,Andrew Knight,318

348,Is very much the fact that we make a promise in our vision and our mission statement to provide a return on investment for alumni over the course of their entire careers. And so that's what we are.,00:11:57.030,00:11:43.530,Andrew Knight,344
349,"Working on with the Lifelong Learning Initiative, which is one quadrant of olins always Olin initiative.",00:12:04.590,00:11:57.360,Andrew Knight,345
350,As you've seen in some of the slides at the outset we are building currently,00:12:11.460,00:12:06.300,Andrew Knight,346
351,"And testing currently a platform that will support alumni learning in community. And so this is a platform that's going to be used to deliver content, similar to what we're going to experience today, but also other",00:12:25.650,00:12:12.060,Andrew Knight,347
352,"events that happen on campus, other kinds of thought leadership from our faculty as well as from alumni. And so this platform is going to be steadily rolling out in the weeks and months that come",00:12:38.850,00:12:26.010,Andrew Knight,348
353,You'll be able to find archived content things that have happened at the school in the past that we think are relevant.,00:12:44.430,00:12:39.390,Andrew Knight,349
354,And there will be opportunities for you to engage with your fellow alumni around some of those pieces of content so that you're sharing your expertise wisdom and insights with one another.,00:12:57.510,00:12:44.730,Andrew Knight,350
355,"Now as I mentioned at the start, we are so fortunate today to have with us. Professor liberty visitors.",00:13:05.250,00:12:57.960,Andrew Knight,351
356,Who is a Professor of Practice of data science here in the business school and she is someone who truly practices. What she preaches,00:13:14.520,00:13:05.670,Andrew Knight,352
357,She is active in disseminating her knowledge and expertise with respect to statistics data and analytics through so many different channels.,00:13:24.300,00:13:14.910,Andrew Knight,353
358,"Whether that is through the popular media where you might encounter some of her work and commentary, or through doing things like writing a book which is coming out here on the horizon.",00:13:36.420,00:13:24.690,Andrew Knight,354
359,"Just this month. And so we are so fortunate to have someone who is skilled and has deep expertise in this topic, and at the same time someone who is a skilled communicator about this topic. And so without further ado, please join me in welcoming Professor liberty that hurt.",00:13:55.740,00:13:36.840,Andrew Knight,355
360,"Hi, everybody. Thank you. I think I need to fire my PR person. And have you, Andrew. That was great. Um, does the screen. Look. Okay. Can you all see it.",00:14:05.850,00:13:57.180,Paul McCartney,356
361,"I think I hope I shared it right I'm learning zoom. Okay. Um, thank you all so much for having me here today I wanted to sort of",00:14:14.310,00:14:06.240,Paul McCartney,357
362,dive right in. I have these two graphs or two if you get bored listening to me talk,00:14:19.950,00:14:15.030,Paul McCartney,358
363,"But, um, you know, we've lived as humanists in our decision making for a very long time we go off our thoughts or opinions, our experience our gut and we are now living in this era of data ism.",00:14:32.610,00:14:20.280,Paul McCartney,359
364,"Where we have data drive our decisions, you know, from climate change to health care the refugee crisis. These all encompassing issues.",00:14:40.980,00:14:33.060,Paul McCartney,360
365,"But also in our everyday lives. You know, I don't go to the bookstore anymore. Amazon tells me what to read or dating apps tell you who you're compatible with",00:14:50.310,00:14:41.400,Paul McCartney,361
366,And I read an article like two or three days ago from new research that red wine is terrible for you and I swear. Two days later I read that red wine is wonderful for you and you should drink it.,00:15:01.800,00:14:50.700,Paul McCartney,362
367,"And it feels almost that humanism and data ism, or sort of pushing back against each other right now. Some people want to still go with that gut instinct and others want to have the drive are every decision.",00:15:13.890,00:15:02.340,Paul McCartney,363
368,But really the future is about bringing them together and that's what we're going to sort of touch on and have a taste of today is how we can get incredible ideas from data.,00:15:24.300,00:15:14.280,Paul McCartney,364
369,"But we also need to use that human touch. And I also want to say please use common questions, anything you want in the chat and makes it a lot more fun.",00:15:33.870,00:15:24.900,Paul McCartney,365
370,"Throughout the whole thing and I'll respond as we go. Um, so I want to start before we go into our many examples. And by the way, all these examples are short. So if one's boring. Just wait a couple minutes moving to a new one.",00:15:47.130,00:15:34.290,Paul McCartney,366
371,"Um, I wanted to visit with a French monk from the 17th century Blaise Pascal. You might also remember them from high school without Pascal's triangle so Pascal was a French monk who had a crisis of faith, but he decided to analyze his data.",00:16:05.160,00:15:47.700,Paul McCartney,367
372,"He felt that he had four scenarios. First, God doesn't exist, but he chooses to believe in God. He may live a wasted life with false belief, but when he dies, nothing happens.",00:16:20.550,00:16:06.330,Paul McCartney,368
373,"Now, he could not believe in God and God doesn't exist, and he may not have lived a wasted life of false belief, but again, when he dies, nothing happens.",00:16:30.990,00:16:21.300,Paul McCartney,369
374,"Now the third option God exists, and he believes in God, when he dies, he has the best case scenario heaven for him.",00:16:40.350,00:16:32.310,Paul McCartney,370
375,"But if God exists, and we don't believe in God. The fourth scenario, then it's eternal Hellfire really bad thing.",00:16:48.240,00:16:40.980,Paul McCartney,371
376,So what Pascal decided to do was to minimize the risk of the bad thing happening by believing in God and maximizing the potential is a good thing.,00:16:58.650,00:16:48.810,Paul McCartney,372
377,So he ruled out this possibility and left a 5050 chance of the best thing happening.,00:17:05.220,00:16:59.010,Paul McCartney,373
378,And that's really what data science is it's taking information from past and current events to predict the likelihood of a future event happening really the closest thing to a crystal ball. But the world has,00:17:19.260,00:17:05.820,Paul McCartney,374
379,The only difference between us and Pascal is we don't have four scenarios or four pieces of information we have endless amounts of data that is telling us what to do.,00:17:29.940,00:17:19.740,Paul McCartney,375
380,"And we also have something else. We're not sitting in a monastery, while we do this, we are having governments, businesses companies managers customers, clients even scientists, researchers",00:17:42.030,00:17:30.300,Paul McCartney,376
381,Trying to inform manipulate or persuade us using this data. So we need to be able to ask the right questions when data comes to us from a report or study or anything comes to us.,00:17:56.550,00:17:42.450,Paul McCartney,377
382,I want to discuss the questions that I ask every time I see one of these things. So we're going to have our for questions. And we're going to have examples of how if someone had just asked those questions.,00:18:08.640,00:17:56.880,Paul McCartney,378
383,"Everything would have been averted. The downside would have been minimized and the upside maximized. So let's start with our first question, who",00:18:17.190,00:18:08.910,Paul McCartney,379
384,"OJ Simpson, one of the most infamous criminal trials in American history to remind you. Oh Jay was an NFL superstar accused of murdering his ex WIFE NICOLE SIMPSON AND her lover Ronald while Goodman. I'm sure all of a lot of you remember the",00:18:33.810,00:18:18.720,Paul McCartney,380
385,"Case, and I'm sure a lot of you who are a little bit younger might remember one the Kardashian father is one of his lawyers, just to try to give some parallels there.",00:18:42.660,00:18:34.260,Paul McCartney,381
386,"Um, but, Alan Dershowitz whatever your personal feelings of him might be a fate is a famed legal mind in America, and he made a very interesting statistical argument during the trial.",00:18:54.630,00:18:43.290,Paul McCartney,382
387,He said that while it was known and definite that OJ beat Nicole absolutely no contest. So the fact that he physically abused her that it didn't matter.,00:19:04.980,00:18:55.110,Paul McCartney,383
388,"Because 4 million women in the United States are abused by their domestic partners, every year, but only one in 2500 of them are then murdered by their domestic partner. So the chance that OJ did it is one in 2500 and you can't convict someone on a one in 2500 chains.",00:19:23.190,00:19:05.610,Paul McCartney,384
389,"However, what the jury and most certainly the prosecution should have realized is that the statistic that Mr Dershowitz stated was completely irrelevant and here's why and Mr Dershowitz situation we have a living women who are currently domestic victims of domestic abuse.",00:19:43.830,00:19:24.360,Paul McCartney,385
390,"But at the time of the trial. NICOLE SIMPSON WAS NOT A living woman who's a victim of domestic abuse, whose chance of dying is one in 2500",00:19:54.090,00:19:44.850,Paul McCartney,386
391,But she's a murdered woman who was a victim of domestic abuse. We don't want to know the statistic about living women. We want to know the statistic about murdered women.,00:20:05.730,00:19:54.660,Paul McCartney,387
392,Who were victims of domestic abuse. And the question we want to know is that if you were a murdered woman.,00:20:12.510,00:20:06.120,Paul McCartney,388
393,"Who was a victim of domestic abuse, what is the chance that the guy who abused you murdered you versus being the victim of some random homicide.",00:20:23.400,00:20:13.230,Paul McCartney,389
394,"And in that case, the chance is nine and 10 so the chance that OJ killed Nicole was actually 90% not one in 2500",00:20:33.270,00:20:23.910,Paul McCartney,390
395,Though who we really wanted to know this statistic about changed everything.,00:20:39.210,00:20:33.900,Paul McCartney,391
396,"And it is so easy to miss the prosecution had their entire careers writing on this case, the whole world was watch it and they missed it.",00:20:48.930,00:20:39.720,Paul McCartney,392
397,This simple slip of the tongue of who we really want to know our data about living women who are victims murdered women who were changes everything. So that who question is integral whenever you get data.,00:21:01.890,00:20:49.560,Paul McCartney,393
398,Let's look at one more example of that Abraham Wald was a Jewish statistician who'd been locked out of the University positions and fled to the US before World War Two.,00:21:12.930,00:21:03.150,Paul McCartney,394
399,To avoid persecution and hungry.,00:21:15.360,00:21:13.500,Paul McCartney,395
400,"And he was recruited to help with the Allied cause and look at plane bombers that came back, he was told the analyze the bullet wounds on the plane bombers that came back.",00:21:25.350,00:21:16.170,Paul McCartney,396
401,"And decide which area of the plane that he should reinforce. So my question is, if you're Abraham walled, how do you decide by looking at these planes.",00:21:35.190,00:21:25.620,Paul McCartney,397
402,"What area, you should reinforce if you reinforce 10% of the plane.",00:21:39.510,00:21:35.550,Paul McCartney,398
403,"And he started with this data. This is the data. He had of all the planes that had come back bullet holes per square foot of the section of the plan. So just take one second, five seconds and think, where you would reinforce the plane. If you were Walt. Given this data.",00:21:57.210,00:21:40.080,Paul McCartney,399
404,Anyone is brave enough to put it into the chat. I'll be very impressed.,00:22:02.670,00:21:59.160,Paul McCartney,400
405,Real cockpit. Great.,00:22:06.060,00:22:04.590,Paul McCartney,401
406,Anywhere but we have everyone is too smart here.,00:22:10.320,00:22:07.440,Paul McCartney,402
407,Where the red dots are red gunner everyone is really smart here okay engines. So what most people think,00:22:20.100,00:22:12.780,Paul McCartney,403
408,"And what most people say is the area where there are the most bullets. Right. So the wings, the fuselage where the dots are the areas most bullets. That is what most people think and the most obvious answer.",00:22:31.290,00:22:20.460,Paul McCartney,404
409,What Walt is so famous for doing is saying that's actually not where we put it where we need to reinforce the planes or the undamaged parts and here's why.,00:22:43.950,00:22:31.740,Paul McCartney,405
410,"We have to who's we have planes that crashed abroad, the planes, the bombers that didn't make it back.",00:22:51.660,00:22:44.580,Paul McCartney,406
411,"And we have the planes that wall does able to see that we have did trivia. Trivia, I just saw this question in the chat, maybe lose my train of thought the trivia that came back. Now the planes that returned home.",00:23:03.330,00:22:52.020,Paul McCartney,407
412,"So we have two samples planes that crashed abroad planes that returned home, these are the ones come and see my cursor. I hope so. So I'm like pointing at the screen to which obviously you can see",00:23:12.510,00:23:03.660,Paul McCartney,408
413,"The planes that returned home, or what Walt was able to see and those planes when they got hit on the wings or the cockpit.",00:23:21.390,00:23:12.990,Paul McCartney,409
414,Right here. There's the cockpit. This is our engine when they got hit in the wings. They did their job. They made it back.,00:23:28.500,00:23:22.410,Paul McCartney,410
415,"They were not hit in the cockpit or the engine, the planes that crashed abroad, when they were hit in the cockpit or engine. They couldn't make it back.",00:23:38.340,00:23:29.430,Paul McCartney,411
416,"So, those who were looking at, or sometimes ones we can't even see and it gives us a whole nother answer of where we should be reinforcing the planes, so that both groups, both samples are able to make it back.",00:23:51.720,00:23:38.940,Paul McCartney,412
417,"So this brings us to our second question we have our first have who is the data really about, who do we want to know this data about and next",00:24:01.950,00:23:54.000,Paul McCartney,413
418,"Is what exactly are we, why are we prone to making this type of mistake error. Very good question. Andrew",00:24:07.980,00:24:02.190,Paul McCartney,414
419,"Part of what happens when we're trying to think about these things is we miss the simple answer right. Where's look so focused on looking at the data, the planes that made it back.",00:24:17.370,00:24:08.460,Paul McCartney,415
420,"That we don't take a step back and say, Who is it that we really care about. We don't really care about the planes that made it back, right, because they made it back. They did their job.",00:24:26.400,00:24:17.640,Paul McCartney,416
421,"We actually care about the who didn't make it back. So it's, it's all about taking one step back from the data and asking these actually very broad stroke questions.",00:24:37.260,00:24:26.640,Paul McCartney,417
422,"So our second question is, what what is, what is it that we really want to know if our data.",00:24:43.350,00:24:38.340,Paul McCartney,418
423,"Uber, there was an Uber ban in London Transport for London office. The authorizing authority for all taxis in London band Uber.",00:24:52.170,00:24:44.010,Paul McCartney,419
424,"Now, there's a lot of questions about why exactly they did it. But why they said they did it. Is that Uber was dangerous Uber had become associated with sexual assaults. I remember I was in London.",00:25:03.180,00:24:52.530,Paul McCartney,420
425,"I was getting an Uber. I was on the phone with my father and I said, Dad. I'll call you back. And he said, No, no, no. Liberty. Where are you, I said, I'm getting into Uber. He goes no, I've heard those are so dangerous in London. You can't get into what",00:25:13.920,00:25:03.480,Paul McCartney,421
426,"It's like 4pm on a Tuesday. But anyway, the public believed that Uber was dangerous the public truly believed it. So how, how did the public come to believe that Uber was dangerous.",00:25:25.740,00:25:14.130,Paul McCartney,422
427,"Well, the London taxi drivers Association, which is what you think of when you think of a black cab in London. They put up an advertisement.",00:25:33.900,00:25:26.160,Paul McCartney,423
428,Last year there are 154 rapes and sexual assaults by many cab drivers in London at least 32 of these Uber drivers.,00:25:42.330,00:25:34.620,Paul McCartney,424
429,There's also an image of a girl her makeup is streaming down her face. She is clearly just been sexually assaulted.,00:25:48.240,00:25:42.600,Paul McCartney,425
430,I just wanted to go home. Don't take a risk with a mini cap that's an incredibly powerful advertisement. And if you notice the Metropolitan Police. The London Police logo.,00:25:59.970,00:25:48.570,Paul McCartney,426
431,And the Transport for London office logo are both at the bottom of this ad incredibly powerful.,00:26:05.640,00:26:00.210,Paul McCartney,427
432,"And just do us a little bit of vocab when they say taxis taxis are black cabs, which are what you think of when you think of a London cab and mini caps that's any other type of private car transportation",00:26:16.740,00:26:05.880,Paul McCartney,428
433,"Uber's included so when they say 154 rapes and sexual assaults by mini cab drivers in London, they mean everything but blackcaps",00:26:24.630,00:26:17.370,Paul McCartney,429
434,Very powerful advertisement. The problem is that it wasn't true.,00:26:28.560,00:26:25.080,Paul McCartney,430
435,"What the freedom of information request act actually said is that there were 154 allegations of rape or sexual assault, where the suspect was alleged to be a taxi driver that includes blackcaps 32 of these or by an Uber driver.",00:26:42.660,00:26:29.130,Paul McCartney,431
436,"So clearly the black cab Association had taken themselves out of this when they were asked about this. They said, oops, sorry clerical error.",00:26:53.430,00:26:43.920,Paul McCartney,432
437,"Oh, we'll take it down and they did and they put up another one last year there 32 allegations of rape or sexual assault made against Uber drivers, the same image of the girl her makeup streaming down her face. She has clearly just been sexually assaulted. I just wanted to go home.",00:27:10.500,00:26:54.210,Paul McCartney,433
438,"Why up your risk with a mini cab. Now, it's true. The information is true. But, what question do we really want to know of our data.",00:27:19.770,00:27:11.970,Paul McCartney,434
439,Do you really up your risk. So let's take a look at the very simple numbers. We were given the wrong number of salts 32 by Uber drivers 154 total,00:27:31.380,00:27:21.030,Paul McCartney,435
440,But is that really what we want to know of our numbers. Is that really what we want to know of our data.,00:27:36.600,00:27:31.650,Paul McCartney,436
441,"If Uber was responsible for 32 sexual assaults, but only did 32 journeys, the entire year in London, they would be very dangerous. There's 100% chance you'll be sexually assaulted. If you get an Uber.",00:27:48.540,00:27:37.110,Paul McCartney,437
442,What if they did millions of journeys. What if they did many more than all of the others. So let's take a look.,00:27:54.660,00:27:48.900,Paul McCartney,438
443,Proportion of sexual assaults by Uber drivers 32 by Uber 154 total. So they are Uber's responsible for 20% of a sexual assaults in London.,00:28:04.830,00:27:55.020,Paul McCartney,439
444,"But how many journeys are they responsible for number of journeys in London and any kind of taxi, including Uber's 3,000,001 million of those are completed by Uber.",00:28:15.600,00:28:05.340,Paul McCartney,440
445,"So Uber is responsible for 33% of the journeys, but only 20% of the sexual assaults, meaning that Uber is actually a safer way to get around than any other type of tax.",00:28:31.740,00:28:16.020,Paul McCartney,441
446,"And what about these headlines, the number of cab drivers charged with violence or sexual offenses in London. Is it a five year high",00:28:39.300,00:28:32.640,Paul McCartney,442
447,Trying to say that with the introduction of Uber London has taxis have gotten much less safe well in 2015 there 136 reports of rape or sexual assault by taxis. When this headline was written.,00:28:51.060,00:28:39.570,Paul McCartney,443
448,"And what is the definition of a five year high, it means it was just as high five years ago in 2009 three years before Uber even started there 136 reports of rape or sexual assault by taxi drivers Uber had nothing to do with making it more unsafe.",00:29:07.200,00:28:51.480,Paul McCartney,444
449,Now this seems like an unfortunate situation for Uber. But there's more to it. There's 3.5 million customers who last and arguably better product.,00:29:15.090,00:29:07.740,Paul McCartney,445
450,"40,000 jobs are potentially lost from this and most Uber drivers and lease or contract higher their cars and then obviously the revenue for Uber in London.",00:29:24.600,00:29:15.480,Paul McCartney,446
451,"So what we really want to know of our data, the raw numbers. The proportions, the relative proportions changes the entire analysis.",00:29:33.660,00:29:24.930,Paul McCartney,447
452,So now we'll do one more example of what that's a little bit lighter and my mother. My mother was very excited when she saw these headlines.,00:29:41.910,00:29:34.650,Paul McCartney,448
453,"Chocolate can stave off all simers as cocoa, the brain drug of the future chocolate improves brain function. This is about a year and a half ago, my mother was ecstatic. She called me. She said, liberty, I told you so.",00:29:53.850,00:29:42.210,Paul McCartney,449
454,This is amazing. And she asked me the question that we probably wanted to ask of the data. How much chocolate. Can you look back at the study liberty. How much chocolate. Can I actually get to eat.,00:30:08.910,00:29:54.720,Paul McCartney,450
455,"In order to potentially reduce my risk. So that was the question she asked, and that is what we want to know. Right. How much chocolate. Do I get to eat to potentially reduce my risk.",00:30:21.510,00:30:09.810,Paul McCartney,451
456,"Well, it's obviously not chocolate. That's what reduces our risk. It's a bioactive called flavanols and flavanols are in chocolate. They're also in red wine.",00:30:30.930,00:30:21.960,Paul McCartney,452
457,"And so the question really is, is how many flavanols. Do I have to eat every day. And that's 510 milligrams. So unless you're going to take a five and all pill. You want to know how many flavanols are in chocolate.",00:30:43.230,00:30:31.620,Paul McCartney,453
458,"So let's say you, um, you're not really a chocolate person, but you might drink, eat some cocoa powder, you know, put it in, mix it into water a little hot chocolate.",00:30:52.050,00:30:43.890,Paul McCartney,454
459,And you'd have to have 20 cups of hot chocolate every day in order to potentially reduce your risk.,00:30:58.470,00:30:52.500,Paul McCartney,455
460,If you don't like hot chocolate and your dark chocolate person you'd have to have 1600 calories of dark chocolate every day.,00:31:05.730,00:30:58.710,Paul McCartney,456
461,And if you're like me and you like milk chocolate. That's 3900 calories every day of milk chocolate.,00:31:12.810,00:31:06.030,Paul McCartney,457
462,"In order to potentially reduce your risk. Now, I'm not saying I couldn't do that. Okay, but I am saying that I would die of something else, way before I had to worry about getting Alzheimer's or dementia.",00:31:24.750,00:31:13.050,Paul McCartney,458
463,"And yes, this as well as the previous example, I'm looking at the chat does have enormous really really fascinating correlations to health care and we're actually going to do one of those examples. Next, especially with Kobe that I think should be interesting for everyone to see.",00:31:41.790,00:31:25.530,Paul McCartney,459
464,"So the question of what we really want to know what we care about death by chocolate yes 3900 calories a day. I think we could do it for a little while, but it may not be great.",00:31:51.840,00:31:42.960,Paul McCartney,460
465,"And I also I, you know, when I was looking back at this study from my mom, I thought, you know, I wonder who funded",00:31:57.720,00:31:52.110,Paul McCartney,461
466,"This study who wanted us to think that chocolate was so great for us. And it's amazing that Mars center for cocoa health science was in charge of the research for this one. They just, you know, so kind of them to want us to, you know, have their products do good for us very frightened.",00:32:12.810,00:31:58.110,Paul McCartney,462
467,"So we get to our third question we have, who is the data. What do we really want to know, and we get to how is it interpreted",00:32:21.870,00:32:14.400,Paul McCartney,463
468,"So french fries. I like chocolate. But I like French fries, a lot better and I saw this this headline come out eight year study",00:32:29.550,00:32:22.170,Paul McCartney,464
469,Finds heavy french fry eaters have double the chance of death could french fries be killing you french fries are killing you.,00:32:37.830,00:32:29.790,Paul McCartney,465
470,This is true. According to a peer reviewed study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and what the journal actually said,00:32:46.410,00:32:38.130,Paul McCartney,466
471,"Is that if you eat any form of fried potato more than twice a week, which means three times per week or more you double your risk of death.",00:32:54.270,00:32:47.070,Paul McCartney,467
472,"And it's true. That is what the journal said, and I went back to the study. So let's, let's start with our questions who well in the study. The average person was a 60 YEAR OLD MAN Okay.",00:33:06.450,00:32:54.660,Paul McCartney,468
473,"And what we really want to know is, we want to know what the differences for risk of death of a 60 year old man, if you eat no potatoes. No french fries versus if you do",00:33:17.670,00:33:07.170,Paul McCartney,469
474,"And that is doubling your risk of death. So our COO and our what makes sense. The question is, is how is it interpreted. So let's look at it a little bit of a different way than doubling your risk of death.",00:33:29.280,00:33:18.030,Paul McCartney,470
475,"If you're a 60 year old man, your risk of death at any point in time, regardless of how much you eat.",00:33:35.220,00:33:29.820,Paul McCartney,471
476,"Is 1% meaning that if I line up 160 year old men. One of them will die in the next year, just by virtue of the fact that they're 60 and their male sorry 60 year old man apologize but it's going to be better at the end.",00:33:47.820,00:33:35.880,Paul McCartney,472
477,"Now, if these 100 men eat french fries three times per week or more for their entire lives instead of one of them dying.",00:34:02.190,00:33:48.570,Paul McCartney,473
478,"To will we double our risk of death instead of one, two, which is still bad. Okay, but it sounds a whole lot better to go from a 1% to a 2% then doubling your risk of death.",00:34:15.390,00:34:03.180,Paul McCartney,474
479,"And I also, you know, I don't know about you guys, but when I eat french",00:34:19.260,00:34:16.320,Paul McCartney,475
480,"Like I eat french fries. I love them, but I don't really just eat french fries. Right. I have like a couple of beers. I have a big old juicy cheeseburger right there with me.",00:34:28.950,00:34:19.530,Paul McCartney,476
481,"And you know if I'm eating french fries three times per week or more, I'm not sure I'm like eating perfectly healthy. The rest of the time. Okay.",00:34:36.390,00:34:29.250,Paul McCartney,477
482,I may not exactly be you know out there running five miles per day. If I'm eating french fries three times per week or more. So could it potentially be something else that has an effect on this.,00:34:46.290,00:34:36.570,Paul McCartney,478
483,"So that how we interpret, whether it's double risk of death or one in 100 to two and 100 and these dudes get to eat french fries. All time",00:34:54.960,00:34:47.220,Paul McCartney,479
484,changes how we see this data. Let's look at another example. And this brings us to the covert testing that we were discussing here earlier.,00:35:03.360,00:34:55.500,Paul McCartney,480
485,"And yes, it is too bad that we can't rely on news outlets, you really have to think about these things and ask these questions yourself, which is very, very difficult.",00:35:12.210,00:35:03.690,Paul McCartney,481
486,"Okay, I have the antibodies. So it's safe. If we hang out. We now have an antibody test for coven",00:35:19.230,00:35:12.960,Paul McCartney,482
487,Meaning that if you've had coven you take the antibody test. If you have the antibodies. The idea is that you are then immune from coven and you also cannot pass it on to other people.,00:35:28.290,00:35:19.470,Paul McCartney,483
488,For the purposes of this will assume that's true that if you have antibodies. You can you assume that you're immune and you cannot pass it on to other people.,00:35:36.930,00:35:28.800,Paul McCartney,484
489,"And I've had people say this to me. I've had friends say this to me. I have the antibodies. So it's safe. We can hang out. You can be around me and then go be around your elderly parents, no problem.",00:35:46.920,00:35:37.290,Paul McCartney,485
490,"So the question is, is that true, how good is the testing. So the CDC put out guidance to the general public about these antibody tests. They said, and a population or the prevalence is 5% a test with 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity will yield the positive predictive value of 49%",00:36:05.220,00:35:47.550,Paul McCartney,486
491,"Sorry. You think the general person that's taking an antibody test has any idea what that means include. I mean, it takes me and this is what I do for a living. And it takes me a while to sit down there and puzzle out what this means.",00:36:18.090,00:36:06.270,Paul McCartney,487
492,"How are people supposed to really understand this. Yes, this is definitely where the headache comes on. Thank you.",00:36:23.670,00:36:18.660,Paul McCartney,488
493,So let's take a step back and think about what question we really want to know the first test approved by the FDA for coven 19 antibody testing as sent on the CDC website is 95% accurate.,00:36:38.220,00:36:24.360,Paul McCartney,489
494,"What we want to know is what is the chance if your friend comes to you and says, I have the antibodies, it's safe to hang out.",00:36:44.490,00:36:38.790,Paul McCartney,490
495,"What you want to know is what is the chance that an individual actually has the antibodies, assuming they test positive",00:36:52.470,00:36:44.910,Paul McCartney,491
496,Most people would assume based upon the CDC website is that it's 95% the test is 95% accurate. So there's a 95% chance that they have the antibodies and then it's fine.,00:37:02.580,00:36:53.130,Paul McCartney,492
497,Let's take a closer look. If you have an antibody test. There are four possible outcomes outcome. One is you are positive and you test positive the test did its job. You're all good.,00:37:16.080,00:37:03.690,Paul McCartney,493
498,Outcome to is that you are negative for antibodies and you test negative again the test did its job.,00:37:22.800,00:37:16.710,Paul McCartney,494
499,But because the test is not 100% accurate. There are two other possible outcomes. The first is a false negative,00:37:31.650,00:37:23.340,Paul McCartney,495
500,That means the test says you don't have the antibodies test negative. But you do have them the falls apart.,00:37:38.730,00:37:32.070,Paul McCartney,496
501,"Now, that one's not that dangerous, right. It's kind of annoying because you wish you knew that you had the antibodies and you can go out and do stuff.",00:37:45.360,00:37:39.390,Paul McCartney,497
502,"But you're not going to pass the disease on to, and you're going to pass the virus on to anyone else because you're going to think that you don't have the end the body. So you need to stay home.",00:37:53.400,00:37:45.600,Paul McCartney,498
503,"But there's a fourth option, a false positive, the test says you have the antibodies, but you don't",00:38:00.540,00:37:54.180,Paul McCartney,499
504,"And this is the really dangerous one. Because you're going to think that you're going to your immune, you're going to think you can't pass it on to anyone else. And you're going to go out into the wide world and pass it on.",00:38:10.230,00:38:00.990,Paul McCartney,500
505,"So the question is, how often does this happen. So let's let's look. Let's take a real scenario.",00:38:18.270,00:38:11.520,Paul McCartney,501
506,"5% of the population has coded 19 that's what the CDC meant when they said 5% prevalence, meaning that they 5% is had it and we'll test positive for it.",00:38:28.170,00:38:18.690,Paul McCartney,502
507,And the coven 19 antibody test is 95% accurate. So those are two assumptions and starting points. So let's say we have a population of thousand people. Let's say it's 1000 people at work.,00:38:39.150,00:38:28.710,Paul McCartney,503
508,So if there's 5% prevalence in the population 5% of these people have had coven and will test positive for it 5% of 1000 is 50 people so 50 people have antibodies and we'll test positive for tested its job.,00:38:54.150,00:38:40.020,Paul McCartney,504
509,"But the test is only 95% accurate meaning 5% of the time, it won't be accurate.",00:39:00.360,00:38:55.050,Paul McCartney,505
510,"So we will have a 5% false positive rate, people will falsely test positive, it will tell them that they have the antibodies, but they don't 5% of 1000 is again 50 so we have 50 people who will falsely test positive",00:39:15.930,00:39:00.840,Paul McCartney,506
511,"Now out of our thousand people all 100 of these people will test positive all 100 old test positive, but only 50 of them actually have it.",00:39:29.280,00:39:16.890,Paul McCartney,507
512,"Meaning there's only a 50% chance that you actually have the antibodies. So back to our original question of what is the chance to be an individual actually has the antibodies, assuming they test positive",00:39:42.240,00:39:30.060,Paul McCartney,508
513,50%. That's it. It's the same as a toss of a coin. So when we think that if we have the antibodies. We can go back out into the world.,00:39:51.210,00:39:43.230,Paul McCartney,509
514,"There's a 5050 chance that it won't work. Yes. Not all 1000 people get the test that is true, but we're going, we're basing this idea of antibody testing on that it will help us get back to work.",00:40:02.160,00:39:51.750,Paul McCartney,510
515,"And so we would test everyone in the population and how it, but people who test negative impact this style at all in general that number for this 95% accurate what they meant was 5% false positives and 5% false negatives. So there would also be a large issue with that as well.",00:40:19.710,00:40:02.580,Paul McCartney,511
516,Okey dokey.,00:40:22.680,00:40:21.870,Paul McCartney,512
517,"So, how we interpret the data, you know, CDC put out that statement, but how we interpret it as 95% accurate versus actually 5050 changes the entire way that we look at the situation.",00:40:35.310,00:40:24.750,Paul McCartney,513
518,So now we get to our final example of how and my favorite one finished baby boxes in 2013 the BBC put out this article Why finished babies sleep in cardboard boxes.,00:40:47.280,00:40:36.600,Paul McCartney,514
519,It was an article documenting the finished policy of giving every mother a cardboard box baby supplies and the baby would use the box as a bed.,00:40:56.430,00:40:47.760,Paul McCartney,515
520,"And this is a really interesting example of what happened because it exploded all over the place. People were talking about these baby boxes and for me, when my Molly, I will be right back to you. I'm going to write outside talk about that at the end.",00:41:10.020,00:40:57.300,Paul McCartney,516
521,But inside this article was a graph and it showed Finland's incredible decrease in infant mortality rate incredible progress from 1935 down here to 2010,00:41:23.460,00:41:11.790,Paul McCartney,517
522,"And it also included Finland's and current infant mortality rate which is two and 1000 versus the rest of the world, which is 32 and 1000",00:41:31.860,00:41:23.910,Paul McCartney,518
523,So really incredible based upon this policy of sending every mother a baby box.,00:41:38.100,00:41:32.340,Paul McCartney,519
524,"And it sparked an entire industry finished baby boxes British baby boxes. I actually went to a shower recently and the girl, my friend who was having a baby got two baby boxes at this whole industry.",00:41:51.930,00:41:38.730,Paul McCartney,520
525,And it's incredible really this box this cardboard box that can save a baby's life. It's not just any cardboard box. It's an $850 cardboard box.,00:42:01.980,00:41:52.380,Paul McCartney,521
526,"I'm not really sure what they print on that thing. But inside of it actually looks got one to look at it and I'm inside. It has six diapers, which I'm I think any parents would be able to decide how long six diapers last",00:42:14.130,00:42:02.610,Paul McCartney,522
527,"Like two one Z's. A couple books. So really, the, the whole thing is this cardboard box.",00:42:19.410,00:42:14.700,Paul McCartney,523
528,"Is your baby slept one baby slept in a dresser drawer exactly same concept but you know i i would admit I hope the dresser Jordan cost 800 bucks, but you never know.",00:42:28.830,00:42:20.760,Paul McCartney,524
529,"And so, but, you know, okay, if we really believed that this box would save your child's life would save any child's life, you'd say fine 800 bucks. No problem. You would do anything to get that box anything. So the question is, does it",00:42:46.680,00:42:29.670,Paul McCartney,525
530,Let's take a look back at this exact same graph and how we're going to interpret this data and how we're going to interpret this graph.,00:42:55.350,00:42:47.970,Paul McCartney,526
531,"In 1938 Finland had a higher infant mortality profile, then it's other Nordic neighbors and it decided it needed to do something about it.",00:43:04.290,00:42:55.890,Paul McCartney,527
532,"So it went on this incredible marketing campaign convincing others rich, poor educated or uneducated that they if they had their kids sleeping this baby box back kids slept in it they be fine. They'd survive, but this would save their child's life.",00:43:23.040,00:43:04.680,Paul McCartney,528
533,"And when every mother was convinced of this and wanted this baby box. The finished government said, you know, there's actually a catch.",00:43:33.300,00:43:24.300,Paul McCartney,529
534,"In order to get this baby box every mother will get one, but you have to go to prenatal education class.",00:43:41.190,00:43:33.990,Paul McCartney,530
535,So in 1944 the year before the box came out 31% finished and others receive Prenatal Education in 1945 the year after 86% of finished mothers received Prenatal Education. It wasn't the box at all. It was education and general progress of info mortality rates across the world.,00:44:02.010,00:43:42.090,Paul McCartney,531
536,"And the reason we know this is because the infant mortality profile for rich, poor educated and uneducated finished mothers.",00:44:09.630,00:44:03.090,Paul McCartney,532
537,"Is the same as the infant mortality profile for rich and educated mothers in the US, the difference is born on educated mothers in the US have a much higher infant mortality profile. Now you can forgive industry for",00:44:24.420,00:44:09.900,Paul McCartney,533
538,"You know, deciding to profit and go, go forth and conquer off of these finished baby boxes.",00:44:30.330,00:44:25.440,Paul McCartney,534
539,But you would think governments and other governments would sort of look into this sort of how this these baby boxes really worked before embarking upon a scheme.,00:44:40.290,00:44:31.170,Paul McCartney,535
540,To send out baby boxes but no in a baby boxes were sent out in Essex in Birmingham and Scotland. They piloted a program in 2016 and now every single mother and Scotland receives a baby box. No. Prenatal Education required to the tune of I think $13 million of taxpayer money.,00:44:59.820,00:44:40.590,Paul McCartney,536
541,"But you know, that's the UK. We're America or smarter our government would definitely look into this stuff before piloting these baby boxes.",00:45:07.800,00:45:01.020,Paul McCartney,537
542,"Except they don't US states introduced baby boxes to help combat infant mortality in 2017 Alabama New Jersey and Ohio sent out baby boxes to the tune of 15,000,020 6,000,030 $5 million tons and tons of taxpayer money wasted with no Prenatal Education required",00:45:30.630,00:45:08.160,Paul McCartney,538
543,"And if someone had simply asked how is this interpreted. How does, what does this graph really mean we wouldn't be here.",00:45:40.050,00:45:32.160,Paul McCartney,539
544,"And as Alonso asks, How do you get to think to all the questions that are not intuitive to the data presented",00:45:46.470,00:45:40.530,Paul McCartney,540
545,"I know these questions seems stupid who what and how but I am telling you they work if you just take a step back and think, Who is this data about",00:45:57.210,00:45:46.950,Paul McCartney,541
546,"What are we really trying to ask of it and how should we really be interpreting this, it may not give you the answers. It may not make us. It's not going to make you a statistician",00:46:07.650,00:45:57.540,Paul McCartney,542
547,But it will give you a feeling for whether the veracity of this data really need something,00:46:12.990,00:46:07.980,Paul McCartney,543
548,"And this this example leads us to our fourth question of why, why do we care and I want to, I want to use the same baby box numbers. And I want to say, you know,",00:46:24.870,00:46:13.860,Paul McCartney,544
549,"I don't know the difference between 26,000,035 million except that it's 9 million",00:46:29.640,00:46:25.350,Paul McCartney,545
550,"These numbers don't mean anything to me and our jobs and our work and newspapers, we see these numbers. Every time we see billions. We see trillions.",00:46:37.680,00:46:29.940,Paul McCartney,546
551,"For a lot of states 15,000,035. These are rounding errors for states for companies. How do we have a we make these numbers mean something. Why should we care about this money that's lost",00:46:50.130,00:46:37.890,Paul McCartney,547
552,And I would say that going along the lines of anyone looking at this would be interested in sort of Child Health and baby health that we somehow figure out a way to make those numbers mean something in terms of that in terms of their opportunity cost as Mandy says,00:47:04.800,00:46:51.030,Paul McCartney,548
553,"So how do we do that, I would say, then instead of saying that Alabama wasted $15 million of taxpayer money.",00:47:12.210,00:47:05.340,Paul McCartney,549
554,"They could have paid for diapers for a year for 30,000 babies or New Jersey could have bought baby food for a year for 40,000 babies or Ohio could have paid a year salary for 800 new child social care workers.",00:47:29.580,00:47:12.600,Paul McCartney,550
555,We need to turn these numbers into something that matters to people into something that people understand and personally matters to them.,00:47:39.180,00:47:29.880,Paul McCartney,551
556,And that brings me to our last example you know we've talked this whole time about negative things you know the right you know,00:47:46.860,00:47:40.110,Paul McCartney,552
557,"About the, you know, all the manipulative things bad things sneaky things. But there's also incredible things that we can do. There's really incredible things we can do with actually making people care about the numbers.",00:48:00.000,00:47:47.130,Paul McCartney,553
558,"Or in the most severe refugee crisis since world war two and it's only growing UNHCR, the UN Refugee agencies budget for 2016 was $8",00:48:09.240,00:48:00.810,Paul McCartney,554
559,"Billion, but they only got 3 billion. That's $5 billion needed to help people. So what do they do they need to figure out a way to raise more money.",00:48:18.090,00:48:09.690,Paul McCartney,555
560,"That is, but as what needs to be done for this refugee crisis. So how do they do it, and I'm going to show you a very disturbing image. Next, so please. Just be ready for that.",00:48:27.030,00:48:18.540,Paul McCartney,556
561,This is Alan Curtis. He's a three year old Syrian boy who in 2015 was found drowned on a Turkish beach and his family were Syrian refugees fleeing to Europe.,00:48:37.920,00:48:28.560,Paul McCartney,557
562,"This pictures unfathomably horrible event is really what sparked the world's discussion of the Syrian refugee crisis and one would imagine. I mean, how could you not look at that photo and feel sort of a deep on unbelievable sadness and it did increase donations, but not for very long.",00:48:59.640,00:48:38.550,Paul McCartney,558
563,"Three days was how long this image stayed in people's minds. There's absolutely horrible, horrible tragedy, and it was three days that a picture was able to see stay in people's minds.",00:49:12.330,00:49:00.840,Paul McCartney,559
564,"So we decided that we need to figure out what does stay in people's minds what works, what makes them care about the crisis or the issue longer",00:49:22.110,00:49:12.780,Paul McCartney,560
565,"So we did a study and what works and what doesn't. So we call people and we ask them questions and you say, which one of these does this increase or decrease your affinity towards the crisis.",00:49:35.160,00:49:22.920,Paul McCartney,561
566,"So if someone asks you, refugees undergo stringent security checks. Would that make you feel better about refugees or worse and take a second and think what you think most people would feel",00:49:45.390,00:49:35.760,Paul McCartney,562
567,"This question surprised me. It actually decreased people's affinity for the cause, because it reminded them that there are security issues.",00:49:55.260,00:49:47.700,Paul McCartney,563
568,Refugees more likely to graduate college and secure jobs than non refugees.,00:50:01.080,00:49:56.310,Paul McCartney,564
569,Is that going to increase or decrease people support in this case that decreased Democratic support but increased Republican support.,00:50:09.390,00:50:02.220,Paul McCartney,565
570,Nearly half of refugees or children.,00:50:12.450,00:50:10.530,Paul McCartney,566
571,Increased all support Albert Einstein was a refugee think it increased or decreased support it increased all support. We did a test on Catholics.,00:50:23.610,00:50:13.650,Paul McCartney,567
572,"60 million to displace 21 million refugees are fleeing their homes and then we had another one that said, Jesus was a refugee, the numbers had no change in support. Jesus was a refugee had an large increase",00:50:37.980,00:50:24.240,Paul McCartney,568
573,What this told us is that if you say there is a global refugee crisis. They're 16 million displaced. No one cares right these are fleeting numbers. They mean nothing to us and it goes right out of our head.,00:50:50.760,00:50:38.430,Paul McCartney,569
574,"But if we can take the numbers and have them say this is the way it impacts you and what you care about people will become donors, people are affected, and they will remember",00:51:02.250,00:50:51.390,Paul McCartney,570
575,"So we did a campaign during the major league baseball playoffs for each team that you would be watching, we put up their stadium and the number of people.",00:51:11.820,00:51:03.450,Paul McCartney,571
576,"42,000 new people flee their homes on a daily basis. This is the same size as the crowd that you are watching on TV and this case at the Minute Maid Park, home of the Houston Astros",00:51:23.820,00:51:12.060,Paul McCartney,572
577,"It let us take this big number 42,000 people flee their home every day. That means nothing to anyone.",00:51:31.050,00:51:24.450,Paul McCartney,573
578,"And give it a visual from something that people care about, they are watching this stadium, they are watching this crowd. They can see all these people",00:51:41.040,00:51:31.680,Paul McCartney,574
579,"And it meant something it increase donations by 100,000 recurring donors. People, who keep giving",00:51:49.590,00:51:41.550,Paul McCartney,575
580,"If you are able to tell good numerical stories. If you're able to not just take the data analysis, but actually show the why, why we should care about it and make it mean something to people.",00:52:03.900,00:51:50.580,Paul McCartney,576
581,"Then, whether it's for engagement action donation customers whatever you're trying to do. If those numbers can impact someone personally, you can have a lasting decision for them.",00:52:16.320,00:52:04.200,Paul McCartney,577
582,"Really overall what this says is, we come back to data ism and humanism, you know, data gives us incredible insights to things. We'd never be able to see, but we need to retain our own experience and our own tuition.",00:52:33.090,00:52:19.770,Paul McCartney,578
583,"And make sure that we were always asking the right questions of the data. The who the what the how and the, why should we care. And if we're able to do that then we really can deliver true value in both our personal and working moms. Thank you.",00:52:49.770,00:52:33.390,Paul McCartney,579
584,"Thank you very much liberty for sharing such a helpful way of thinking about numbers and I was wondering, in a couple minutes that we have. If you have any",00:53:02.130,00:52:52.410,Andrew Knight,580
585,"Like rules of thumb or your risks that you use when you're reading a news article or, you know, the latest piece of information that comes out about coven. Is there anything that that you do consciously to try to make your way through some of the distortion of numbers.",00:53:20.430,00:53:02.670,Andrew Knight,581
586,"I think the first and most important thing is to not believe any of it right off the bat, and I hate saying that because you don't want to be this.",00:53:28.830,00:53:21.450,Paul McCartney,582
587,"You know, sort of non believer, but you really can't believe it right off the bat, the biggest numbers. The 95% accurate or the double the risk of death. That's what makes you read the article.",00:53:40.350,00:53:29.100,Paul McCartney,583
588,"I will say, I think the headlines are almost always way worse than the article itself. A lot of times the article itself will have the caveats, and will have the the world. Well, if you look at it this way, the headlines never will.",00:53:54.510,00:53:40.620,Paul McCartney,584
589,"Because the headlines are really about getting people to read it. And in general, like I know for example. Whenever I write, I don't get to choose the headline. I have zero SEO for it.",00:54:03.240,00:53:55.020,Paul McCartney,585
590,"And it will be what is going to get people to read it and it's not going to have the well it's not a double a risk of death of you dying from French fries. It's actually you know headline. Oh, a 1% increase in risk of death. It just doesn't get you to read it.",00:54:16.380,00:54:03.600,Paul McCartney,586
591,"So it just takes like scrutinizing i mean i think i dropped something in the chat earlier that, you know, it gives me a headache sometimes to try to make my way through, what is the actual",00:54:29.100,00:54:18.180,Andrew Knight,587
592,risk level that's being presented and of course the always important question that john has dropped in the in the chat to leave us with and maybe you could leave this as a cliffhanger. How do we win the lottery.,00:54:43.470,00:54:30.090,Andrew Knight,588
593,Got to buy the book.,00:54:44.760,00:54:43.830,Paul McCartney,589

595,"Book. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.",00:54:47.310,00:54:46.200,Paul McCartney,591
596,"I actually deleted that example because I was running out of time. Get Away With Murder, you gotta go look at OJ it and it worked out. Sure. You really want to try that. But there's, there's a lot of questions about statistical change of samples.",00:55:02.100,00:54:48.900,Paul McCartney,592
597,"Well, thank you again so much for taking time to share these thoughts with us. And folks, if you can go down to the bottom of your zoom window, you'll see a",00:55:12.000,00:55:03.360,Andrew Knight,593

642,"And if there's one thing I've learned so far from online teaching it is that there is enormous value in having the community that you're a part of right there in front on the screen. And so if you aren't too shy to broadcast your video, please do so.",00:11:01.830,00:10:45.300,Andrew Knight,636
643,We have an outstanding program ahead. And so I just want to take a couple of minutes here at the outset.,00:11:08.910,00:11:02.430,Andrew Knight,637
644,To share with you how this program fits into some of the goals and the work that we're doing.,00:11:15.150,00:11:09.240,Andrew Knight,638
645,"for lifelong learning and so let me just share a couple of slides at the outset, before we welcome Professor liberty visitors who is going to be",00:11:24.180,00:11:15.480,Andrew Knight,639
646,Sharing her expertise and knowledge with us today. As you may or may not know Olin lifelong learning is an initiative.,00:11:33.450,00:11:24.600,Andrew Knight,640
647,That is specifically focused on providing opportunities for alumni to engage in continuous development and the rationale for this initiative.,00:11:42.990,00:11:33.930,Andrew Knight,641
648,Is very much the fact that we make a promise in our vision and our mission statement to provide a return on investment for alumni over the course of their entire careers. And so that's what we are.,00:11:57.030,00:11:43.530,Andrew Knight,642
649,"Working on with the Lifelong Learning Initiative, which is one quadrant of olins always Olin initiative.",00:12:04.590,00:11:57.360,Andrew Knight,643
650,As you've seen in some of the slides at the outset we are building currently,00:12:11.460,00:12:06.300,Andrew Knight,644
651,"And testing currently a platform that will support alumni learning in community. And so this is a platform that's going to be used to deliver content, similar to what we're going to experience today, but also other",00:12:25.650,00:12:12.060,Andrew Knight,645
652,"events that happen on campus, other kinds of thought leadership from our faculty as well as from alumni. And so this platform is going to be steadily rolling out in the weeks and months that come",00:12:38.850,00:12:26.010,Andrew Knight,646
653,You'll be able to find archived content things that have happened at the school in the past that we think are relevant.,00:12:44.430,00:12:39.390,Andrew Knight,647
654,And there will be opportunities for you to engage with your fellow alumni around some of those pieces of content so that you're sharing your expertise wisdom and insights with one another.,00:12:57.510,00:12:44.730,Andrew Knight,648
655,"Now as I mentioned at the start, we are so fortunate today to have with us. Professor liberty visitors.",00:13:05.250,00:12:57.960,Andrew Knight,649
656,Who is a Professor of Practice of data science here in the business school and she is someone who truly practices. What she preaches,00:13:14.520,00:13:05.670,Andrew Knight,650
657,She is active in disseminating her knowledge and expertise with respect to statistics data and analytics through so many different channels.,00:13:24.300,00:13:14.910,Andrew Knight,651
658,"Whether that is through the popular media where you might encounter some of her work and commentary, or through doing things like writing a book which is coming out here on the horizon.",00:13:36.420,00:13:24.690,Andrew Knight,652
659,"Just this month. And so we are so fortunate to have someone who is skilled and has deep expertise in this topic, and at the same time someone who is a skilled communicator about this topic. And so without further ado, please join me in welcoming Professor liberty that hurt.",00:13:55.740,00:13:36.840,Andrew Knight,653
660,"Hi, everybody. Thank you. I think I need to fire my PR person. And have you, Andrew. That was great. Um, does the screen. Look. Okay. Can you all see it.",00:14:05.850,00:13:57.180,Paul McCartney,654
661,"I think I hope I shared it right I'm learning zoom. Okay. Um, thank you all so much for having me here today I wanted to sort of",00:14:14.310,00:14:06.240,Paul McCartney,655
662,dive right in. I have these two graphs or two if you get bored listening to me talk,00:14:19.950,00:14:15.030,Paul McCartney,656
663,"But, um, you know, we've lived as humanists in our decision making for a very long time we go off our thoughts or opinions, our experience our gut and we are now living in this era of data ism.",00:14:32.610,00:14:20.280,Paul McCartney,657
664,"Where we have data drive our decisions, you know, from climate change to health care the refugee crisis. These all encompassing issues.",00:14:40.980,00:14:33.060,Paul McCartney,658
665,"But also in our everyday lives. You know, I don't go to the bookstore anymore. Amazon tells me what to read or dating apps tell you who you're compatible with",00:14:50.310,00:14:41.400,Paul McCartney,659
666,And I read an article like two or three days ago from new research that red wine is terrible for you and I swear. Two days later I read that red wine is wonderful for you and you should drink it.,00:15:01.800,00:14:50.700,Paul McCartney,660
667,"And it feels almost that humanism and data ism, or sort of pushing back against each other right now. Some people want to still go with that gut instinct and others want to have the drive are every decision.",00:15:13.890,00:15:02.340,Paul McCartney,661
668,But really the future is about bringing them together and that's what we're going to sort of touch on and have a taste of today is how we can get incredible ideas from data.,00:15:24.300,00:15:14.280,Paul McCartney,662
669,"But we also need to use that human touch. And I also want to say please use common questions, anything you want in the chat and makes it a lot more fun.",00:15:33.870,00:15:24.900,Paul McCartney,663
670,"Throughout the whole thing and I'll respond as we go. Um, so I want to start before we go into our many examples. And by the way, all these examples are short. So if one's boring. Just wait a couple minutes moving to a new one.",00:15:47.130,00:15:34.290,Paul McCartney,664
671,"Um, I wanted to visit with a French monk from the 17th century Blaise Pascal. You might also remember them from high school without Pascal's triangle so Pascal was a French monk who had a crisis of faith, but he decided to analyze his data.",00:16:05.160,00:15:47.700,Paul McCartney,665
672,"He felt that he had four scenarios. First, God doesn't exist, but he chooses to believe in God. He may live a wasted life with false belief, but when he dies, nothing happens.",00:16:20.550,00:16:06.330,Paul McCartney,666
673,"Now, he could not believe in God and God doesn't exist, and he may not have lived a wasted life of false belief, but again, when he dies, nothing happens.",00:16:30.990,00:16:21.300,Paul McCartney,667
674,"Now the third option God exists, and he believes in God, when he dies, he has the best case scenario heaven for him.",00:16:40.350,00:16:32.310,Paul McCartney,668
675,"But if God exists, and we don't believe in God. The fourth scenario, then it's eternal Hellfire really bad thing.",00:16:48.240,00:16:40.980,Paul McCartney,669
676,So what Pascal decided to do was to minimize the risk of the bad thing happening by believing in God and maximizing the potential is a good thing.,00:16:58.650,00:16:48.810,Paul McCartney,670
677,So he ruled out this possibility and left a 5050 chance of the best thing happening.,00:17:05.220,00:16:59.010,Paul McCartney,671
678,And that's really what data science is it's taking information from past and current events to predict the likelihood of a future event happening really the closest thing to a crystal ball. But the world has,00:17:19.260,00:17:05.820,Paul McCartney,672
679,The only difference between us and Pascal is we don't have four scenarios or four pieces of information we have endless amounts of data that is telling us what to do.,00:17:29.940,00:17:19.740,Paul McCartney,673
680,"And we also have something else. We're not sitting in a monastery, while we do this, we are having governments, businesses companies managers customers, clients even scientists, researchers",00:17:42.030,00:17:30.300,Paul McCartney,674
681,Trying to inform manipulate or persuade us using this data. So we need to be able to ask the right questions when data comes to us from a report or study or anything comes to us.,00:17:56.550,00:17:42.450,Paul McCartney,675
682,I want to discuss the questions that I ask every time I see one of these things. So we're going to have our for questions. And we're going to have examples of how if someone had just asked those questions.,00:18:08.640,00:17:56.880,Paul McCartney,676
683,"Everything would have been averted. The downside would have been minimized and the upside maximized. So let's start with our first question, who",00:18:17.190,00:18:08.910,Paul McCartney,677
684,"OJ Simpson, one of the most infamous criminal trials in American history to remind you. Oh Jay was an NFL superstar accused of murdering his ex WIFE NICOLE SIMPSON AND her lover Ronald while Goodman. I'm sure all of a lot of you remember the",00:18:33.810,00:18:18.720,Paul McCartney,678
685,"Case, and I'm sure a lot of you who are a little bit younger might remember one the Kardashian father is one of his lawyers, just to try to give some parallels there.",00:18:42.660,00:18:34.260,Paul McCartney,679
686,"Um, but, Alan Dershowitz whatever your personal feelings of him might be a fate is a famed legal mind in America, and he made a very interesting statistical argument during the trial.",00:18:54.630,00:18:43.290,Paul McCartney,680
687,He said that while it was known and definite that OJ beat Nicole absolutely no contest. So the fact that he physically abused her that it didn't matter.,00:19:04.980,00:18:55.110,Paul McCartney,681
688,"Because 4 million women in the United States are abused by their domestic partners, every year, but only one in 2500 of them are then murdered by their domestic partner. So the chance that OJ did it is one in 2500 and you can't convict someone on a one in 2500 chains.",00:19:23.190,00:19:05.610,Paul McCartney,682
689,"However, what the jury and most certainly the prosecution should have realized is that the statistic that Mr Dershowitz stated was completely irrelevant and here's why and Mr Dershowitz situation we have a living women who are currently domestic victims of domestic abuse.",00:19:43.830,00:19:24.360,Paul McCartney,683
690,"But at the time of the trial. NICOLE SIMPSON WAS NOT A living woman who's a victim of domestic abuse, whose chance of dying is one in 2500",00:19:54.090,00:19:44.850,Paul McCartney,684
691,But she's a murdered woman who was a victim of domestic abuse. We don't want to know the statistic about living women. We want to know the statistic about murdered women.,00:20:05.730,00:19:54.660,Paul McCartney,685
692,Who were victims of domestic abuse. And the question we want to know is that if you were a murdered woman.,00:20:12.510,00:20:06.120,Paul McCartney,686
693,"Who was a victim of domestic abuse, what is the chance that the guy who abused you murdered you versus being the victim of some random homicide.",00:20:23.400,00:20:13.230,Paul McCartney,687
694,"And in that case, the chance is nine and 10 so the chance that OJ killed Nicole was actually 90% not one in 2500",00:20:33.270,00:20:23.910,Paul McCartney,688
695,Though who we really wanted to know this statistic about changed everything.,00:20:39.210,00:20:33.900,Paul McCartney,689
696,"And it is so easy to miss the prosecution had their entire careers writing on this case, the whole world was watch it and they missed it.",00:20:48.930,00:20:39.720,Paul McCartney,690
697,This simple slip of the tongue of who we really want to know our data about living women who are victims murdered women who were changes everything. So that who question is integral whenever you get data.,00:21:01.890,00:20:49.560,Paul McCartney,691
698,Let's look at one more example of that Abraham Wald was a Jewish statistician who'd been locked out of the University positions and fled to the US before World War Two.,00:21:12.930,00:21:03.150,Paul McCartney,692
699,To avoid persecution and hungry.,00:21:15.360,00:21:13.500,Paul McCartney,693
700,"And he was recruited to help with the Allied cause and look at plane bombers that came back, he was told the analyze the bullet wounds on the plane bombers that came back.",00:21:25.350,00:21:16.170,Paul McCartney,694
701,"And decide which area of the plane that he should reinforce. So my question is, if you're Abraham walled, how do you decide by looking at these planes.",00:21:35.190,00:21:25.620,Paul McCartney,695
702,"What area, you should reinforce if you reinforce 10% of the plane.",00:21:39.510,00:21:35.550,Paul McCartney,696
703,"And he started with this data. This is the data. He had of all the planes that had come back bullet holes per square foot of the section of the plan. So just take one second, five seconds and think, where you would reinforce the plane. If you were Walt. Given this data.",00:21:57.210,00:21:40.080,Paul McCartney,697
704,Anyone is brave enough to put it into the chat. I'll be very impressed.,00:22:02.670,00:21:59.160,Paul McCartney,698
705,Real cockpit. Great.,00:22:06.060,00:22:04.590,Paul McCartney,699
706,Anywhere but we have everyone is too smart here.,00:22:10.320,00:22:07.440,Paul McCartney,700
707,Where the red dots are red gunner everyone is really smart here okay engines. So what most people think,00:22:20.100,00:22:12.780,Paul McCartney,701
708,"And what most people say is the area where there are the most bullets. Right. So the wings, the fuselage where the dots are the areas most bullets. That is what most people think and the most obvious answer.",00:22:31.290,00:22:20.460,Paul McCartney,702
709,What Walt is so famous for doing is saying that's actually not where we put it where we need to reinforce the planes or the undamaged parts and here's why.,00:22:43.950,00:22:31.740,Paul McCartney,703
710,"We have to who's we have planes that crashed abroad, the planes, the bombers that didn't make it back.",00:22:51.660,00:22:44.580,Paul McCartney,704
711,"And we have the planes that wall does able to see that we have did trivia. Trivia, I just saw this question in the chat, maybe lose my train of thought the trivia that came back. Now the planes that returned home.",00:23:03.330,00:22:52.020,Paul McCartney,705
712,"So we have two samples planes that crashed abroad planes that returned home, these are the ones come and see my cursor. I hope so. So I'm like pointing at the screen to which obviously you can see",00:23:12.510,00:23:03.660,Paul McCartney,706
713,"The planes that returned home, or what Walt was able to see and those planes when they got hit on the wings or the cockpit.",00:23:21.390,00:23:12.990,Paul McCartney,707
714,Right here. There's the cockpit. This is our engine when they got hit in the wings. They did their job. They made it back.,00:23:28.500,00:23:22.410,Paul McCartney,708
715,"They were not hit in the cockpit or the engine, the planes that crashed abroad, when they were hit in the cockpit or engine. They couldn't make it back.",00:23:38.340,00:23:29.430,Paul McCartney,709
716,"So, those who were looking at, or sometimes ones we can't even see and it gives us a whole nother answer of where we should be reinforcing the planes, so that both groups, both samples are able to make it back.",00:23:51.720,00:23:38.940,Paul McCartney,710
717,"So this brings us to our second question we have our first have who is the data really about, who do we want to know this data about and next",00:24:01.950,00:23:54.000,Paul McCartney,711
718,"Is what exactly are we, why are we prone to making this type of mistake error. Very good question. Andrew",00:24:07.980,00:24:02.190,Paul McCartney,712
719,"Part of what happens when we're trying to think about these things is we miss the simple answer right. Where's look so focused on looking at the data, the planes that made it back.",00:24:17.370,00:24:08.460,Paul McCartney,713
720,"That we don't take a step back and say, Who is it that we really care about. We don't really care about the planes that made it back, right, because they made it back. They did their job.",00:24:26.400,00:24:17.640,Paul McCartney,714
721,"We actually care about the who didn't make it back. So it's, it's all about taking one step back from the data and asking these actually very broad stroke questions.",00:24:37.260,00:24:26.640,Paul McCartney,715
722,"So our second question is, what what is, what is it that we really want to know if our data.",00:24:43.350,00:24:38.340,Paul McCartney,716
723,"Uber, there was an Uber ban in London Transport for London office. The authorizing authority for all taxis in London band Uber.",00:24:52.170,00:24:44.010,Paul McCartney,717
724,"Now, there's a lot of questions about why exactly they did it. But why they said they did it. Is that Uber was dangerous Uber had become associated with sexual assaults. I remember I was in London.",00:25:03.180,00:24:52.530,Paul McCartney,718
725,"I was getting an Uber. I was on the phone with my father and I said, Dad. I'll call you back. And he said, No, no, no. Liberty. Where are you, I said, I'm getting into Uber. He goes no, I've heard those are so dangerous in London. You can't get into what",00:25:13.920,00:25:03.480,Paul McCartney,719
726,"It's like 4pm on a Tuesday. But anyway, the public believed that Uber was dangerous the public truly believed it. So how, how did the public come to believe that Uber was dangerous.",00:25:25.740,00:25:14.130,Paul McCartney,720
727,"Well, the London taxi drivers Association, which is what you think of when you think of a black cab in London. They put up an advertisement.",00:25:33.900,00:25:26.160,Paul McCartney,721
728,Last year there are 154 rapes and sexual assaults by many cab drivers in London at least 32 of these Uber drivers.,00:25:42.330,00:25:34.620,Paul McCartney,722
729,There's also an image of a girl her makeup is streaming down her face. She is clearly just been sexually assaulted.,00:25:48.240,00:25:42.600,Paul McCartney,723
730,I just wanted to go home. Don't take a risk with a mini cap that's an incredibly powerful advertisement. And if you notice the Metropolitan Police. The London Police logo.,00:25:59.970,00:25:48.570,Paul McCartney,724
731,And the Transport for London office logo are both at the bottom of this ad incredibly powerful.,00:26:05.640,00:26:00.210,Paul McCartney,725
732,"And just do us a little bit of vocab when they say taxis taxis are black cabs, which are what you think of when you think of a London cab and mini caps that's any other type of private car transportation",00:26:16.740,00:26:05.880,Paul McCartney,726
733,"Uber's included so when they say 154 rapes and sexual assaults by mini cab drivers in London, they mean everything but blackcaps",00:26:24.630,00:26:17.370,Paul McCartney,727
734,Very powerful advertisement. The problem is that it wasn't true.,00:26:28.560,00:26:25.080,Paul McCartney,728
735,"What the freedom of information request act actually said is that there were 154 allegations of rape or sexual assault, where the suspect was alleged to be a taxi driver that includes blackcaps 32 of these or by an Uber driver.",00:26:42.660,00:26:29.130,Paul McCartney,729
736,"So clearly the black cab Association had taken themselves out of this when they were asked about this. They said, oops, sorry clerical error.",00:26:53.430,00:26:43.920,Paul McCartney,730
737,"Oh, we'll take it down and they did and they put up another one last year there 32 allegations of rape or sexual assault made against Uber drivers, the same image of the girl her makeup streaming down her face. She has clearly just been sexually assaulted. I just wanted to go home.",00:27:10.500,00:26:54.210,Paul McCartney,731
738,"Why up your risk with a mini cab. Now, it's true. The information is true. But, what question do we really want to know of our data.",00:27:19.770,00:27:11.970,Paul McCartney,732
739,Do you really up your risk. So let's take a look at the very simple numbers. We were given the wrong number of salts 32 by Uber drivers 154 total,00:27:31.380,00:27:21.030,Paul McCartney,733
740,But is that really what we want to know of our numbers. Is that really what we want to know of our data.,00:27:36.600,00:27:31.650,Paul McCartney,734
741,"If Uber was responsible for 32 sexual assaults, but only did 32 journeys, the entire year in London, they would be very dangerous. There's 100% chance you'll be sexually assaulted. If you get an Uber.",00:27:48.540,00:27:37.110,Paul McCartney,735
742,What if they did millions of journeys. What if they did many more than all of the others. So let's take a look.,00:27:54.660,00:27:48.900,Paul McCartney,736
743,Proportion of sexual assaults by Uber drivers 32 by Uber 154 total. So they are Uber's responsible for 20% of a sexual assaults in London.,00:28:04.830,00:27:55.020,Paul McCartney,737
744,"But how many journeys are they responsible for number of journeys in London and any kind of taxi, including Uber's 3,000,001 million of those are completed by Uber.",00:28:15.600,00:28:05.340,Paul McCartney,738
745,"So Uber is responsible for 33% of the journeys, but only 20% of the sexual assaults, meaning that Uber is actually a safer way to get around than any other type of tax.",00:28:31.740,00:28:16.020,Paul McCartney,739
746,"And what about these headlines, the number of cab drivers charged with violence or sexual offenses in London. Is it a five year high",00:28:39.300,00:28:32.640,Paul McCartney,740
747,Trying to say that with the introduction of Uber London has taxis have gotten much less safe well in 2015 there 136 reports of rape or sexual assault by taxis. When this headline was written.,00:28:51.060,00:28:39.570,Paul McCartney,741
748,"And what is the definition of a five year high, it means it was just as high five years ago in 2009 three years before Uber even started there 136 reports of rape or sexual assault by taxi drivers Uber had nothing to do with making it more unsafe.",00:29:07.200,00:28:51.480,Paul McCartney,742
749,Now this seems like an unfortunate situation for Uber. But there's more to it. There's 3.5 million customers who last and arguably better product.,00:29:15.090,00:29:07.740,Paul McCartney,743
750,"40,000 jobs are potentially lost from this and most Uber drivers and lease or contract higher their cars and then obviously the revenue for Uber in London.",00:29:24.600,00:29:15.480,Paul McCartney,744
751,"So what we really want to know of our data, the raw numbers. The proportions, the relative proportions changes the entire analysis.",00:29:33.660,00:29:24.930,Paul McCartney,745
752,So now we'll do one more example of what that's a little bit lighter and my mother. My mother was very excited when she saw these headlines.,00:29:41.910,00:29:34.650,Paul McCartney,746
753,"Chocolate can stave off all simers as cocoa, the brain drug of the future chocolate improves brain function. This is about a year and a half ago, my mother was ecstatic. She called me. She said, liberty, I told you so.",00:29:53.850,00:29:42.210,Paul McCartney,747
754,This is amazing. And she asked me the question that we probably wanted to ask of the data. How much chocolate. Can you look back at the study liberty. How much chocolate. Can I actually get to eat.,00:30:08.910,00:29:54.720,Paul McCartney,748
755,"In order to potentially reduce my risk. So that was the question she asked, and that is what we want to know. Right. How much chocolate. Do I get to eat to potentially reduce my risk.",00:30:21.510,00:30:09.810,Paul McCartney,749
756,"Well, it's obviously not chocolate. That's what reduces our risk. It's a bioactive called flavanols and flavanols are in chocolate. They're also in red wine.",00:30:30.930,00:30:21.960,Paul McCartney,750
757,"And so the question really is, is how many flavanols. Do I have to eat every day. And that's 510 milligrams. So unless you're going to take a five and all pill. You want to know how many flavanols are in chocolate.",00:30:43.230,00:30:31.620,Paul McCartney,751
758,"So let's say you, um, you're not really a chocolate person, but you might drink, eat some cocoa powder, you know, put it in, mix it into water a little hot chocolate.",00:30:52.050,00:30:43.890,Paul McCartney,752
759,And you'd have to have 20 cups of hot chocolate every day in order to potentially reduce your risk.,00:30:58.470,00:30:52.500,Paul McCartney,753
760,If you don't like hot chocolate and your dark chocolate person you'd have to have 1600 calories of dark chocolate every day.,00:31:05.730,00:30:58.710,Paul McCartney,754
761,And if you're like me and you like milk chocolate. That's 3900 calories every day of milk chocolate.,00:31:12.810,00:31:06.030,Paul McCartney,755
762,"In order to potentially reduce your risk. Now, I'm not saying I couldn't do that. Okay, but I am saying that I would die of something else, way before I had to worry about getting Alzheimer's or dementia.",00:31:24.750,00:31:13.050,Paul McCartney,756
763,"And yes, this as well as the previous example, I'm looking at the chat does have enormous really really fascinating correlations to health care and we're actually going to do one of those examples. Next, especially with Kobe that I think should be interesting for everyone to see.",00:31:41.790,00:31:25.530,Paul McCartney,757
764,"So the question of what we really want to know what we care about death by chocolate yes 3900 calories a day. I think we could do it for a little while, but it may not be great.",00:31:51.840,00:31:42.960,Paul McCartney,758
765,"And I also I, you know, when I was looking back at this study from my mom, I thought, you know, I wonder who funded",00:31:57.720,00:31:52.110,Paul McCartney,759
766,"This study who wanted us to think that chocolate was so great for us. And it's amazing that Mars center for cocoa health science was in charge of the research for this one. They just, you know, so kind of them to want us to, you know, have their products do good for us very frightened.",00:32:12.810,00:31:58.110,Paul McCartney,760
767,"So we get to our third question we have, who is the data. What do we really want to know, and we get to how is it interpreted",00:32:21.870,00:32:14.400,Paul McCartney,761
768,"So french fries. I like chocolate. But I like French fries, a lot better and I saw this this headline come out eight year study",00:32:29.550,00:32:22.170,Paul McCartney,762
769,Finds heavy french fry eaters have double the chance of death could french fries be killing you french fries are killing you.,00:32:37.830,00:32:29.790,Paul McCartney,763
770,This is true. According to a peer reviewed study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and what the journal actually said,00:32:46.410,00:32:38.130,Paul McCartney,764
771,"Is that if you eat any form of fried potato more than twice a week, which means three times per week or more you double your risk of death.",00:32:54.270,00:32:47.070,Paul McCartney,765
772,"And it's true. That is what the journal said, and I went back to the study. So let's, let's start with our questions who well in the study. The average person was a 60 YEAR OLD MAN Okay.",00:33:06.450,00:32:54.660,Paul McCartney,766
773,"And what we really want to know is, we want to know what the differences for risk of death of a 60 year old man, if you eat no potatoes. No french fries versus if you do",00:33:17.670,00:33:07.170,Paul McCartney,767
774,"And that is doubling your risk of death. So our COO and our what makes sense. The question is, is how is it interpreted. So let's look at it a little bit of a different way than doubling your risk of death.",00:33:29.280,00:33:18.030,Paul McCartney,768
775,"If you're a 60 year old man, your risk of death at any point in time, regardless of how much you eat.",00:33:35.220,00:33:29.820,Paul McCartney,769
776,"Is 1% meaning that if I line up 160 year old men. One of them will die in the next year, just by virtue of the fact that they're 60 and their male sorry 60 year old man apologize but it's going to be better at the end.",00:33:47.820,00:33:35.880,Paul McCartney,770
777,"Now, if these 100 men eat french fries three times per week or more for their entire lives instead of one of them dying.",00:34:02.190,00:33:48.570,Paul McCartney,771
778,"To will we double our risk of death instead of one, two, which is still bad. Okay, but it sounds a whole lot better to go from a 1% to a 2% then doubling your risk of death.",00:34:15.390,00:34:03.180,Paul McCartney,772
779,"And I also, you know, I don't know about you guys, but when I eat french",00:34:19.260,00:34:16.320,Paul McCartney,773
780,"Like I eat french fries. I love them, but I don't really just eat french fries. Right. I have like a couple of beers. I have a big old juicy cheeseburger right there with me.",00:34:28.950,00:34:19.530,Paul McCartney,774
781,"And you know if I'm eating french fries three times per week or more, I'm not sure I'm like eating perfectly healthy. The rest of the time. Okay.",00:34:36.390,00:34:29.250,Paul McCartney,775
782,I may not exactly be you know out there running five miles per day. If I'm eating french fries three times per week or more. So could it potentially be something else that has an effect on this.,00:34:46.290,00:34:36.570,Paul McCartney,776
783,"So that how we interpret, whether it's double risk of death or one in 100 to two and 100 and these dudes get to eat french fries. All time",00:34:54.960,00:34:47.220,Paul McCartney,777
784,changes how we see this data. Let's look at another example. And this brings us to the covert testing that we were discussing here earlier.,00:35:03.360,00:34:55.500,Paul McCartney,778
785,"And yes, it is too bad that we can't rely on news outlets, you really have to think about these things and ask these questions yourself, which is very, very difficult.",00:35:12.210,00:35:03.690,Paul McCartney,779
786,"Okay, I have the antibodies. So it's safe. If we hang out. We now have an antibody test for coven",00:35:19.230,00:35:12.960,Paul McCartney,780
787,Meaning that if you've had coven you take the antibody test. If you have the antibodies. The idea is that you are then immune from coven and you also cannot pass it on to other people.,00:35:28.290,00:35:19.470,Paul McCartney,781
788,For the purposes of this will assume that's true that if you have antibodies. You can you assume that you're immune and you cannot pass it on to other people.,00:35:36.930,00:35:28.800,Paul McCartney,782
789,"And I've had people say this to me. I've had friends say this to me. I have the antibodies. So it's safe. We can hang out. You can be around me and then go be around your elderly parents, no problem.",00:35:46.920,00:35:37.290,Paul McCartney,783
790,"So the question is, is that true, how good is the testing. So the CDC put out guidance to the general public about these antibody tests. They said, and a population or the prevalence is 5% a test with 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity will yield the positive predictive value of 49%",00:36:05.220,00:35:47.550,Paul McCartney,784
791,"Sorry. You think the general person that's taking an antibody test has any idea what that means include. I mean, it takes me and this is what I do for a living. And it takes me a while to sit down there and puzzle out what this means.",00:36:18.090,00:36:06.270,Paul McCartney,785
792,"How are people supposed to really understand this. Yes, this is definitely where the headache comes on. Thank you.",00:36:23.670,00:36:18.660,Paul McCartney,786
793,So let's take a step back and think about what question we really want to know the first test approved by the FDA for coven 19 antibody testing as sent on the CDC website is 95% accurate.,00:36:38.220,00:36:24.360,Paul McCartney,787
794,"What we want to know is what is the chance if your friend comes to you and says, I have the antibodies, it's safe to hang out.",00:36:44.490,00:36:38.790,Paul McCartney,788
795,"What you want to know is what is the chance that an individual actually has the antibodies, assuming they test positive",00:36:52.470,00:36:44.910,Paul McCartney,789
796,Most people would assume based upon the CDC website is that it's 95% the test is 95% accurate. So there's a 95% chance that they have the antibodies and then it's fine.,00:37:02.580,00:36:53.130,Paul McCartney,790
797,Let's take a closer look. If you have an antibody test. There are four possible outcomes outcome. One is you are positive and you test positive the test did its job. You're all good.,00:37:16.080,00:37:03.690,Paul McCartney,791
798,Outcome to is that you are negative for antibodies and you test negative again the test did its job.,00:37:22.800,00:37:16.710,Paul McCartney,792
799,But because the test is not 100% accurate. There are two other possible outcomes. The first is a false negative,00:37:31.650,00:37:23.340,Paul McCartney,793
800,That means the test says you don't have the antibodies test negative. But you do have them the falls apart.,00:37:38.730,00:37:32.070,Paul McCartney,794
801,"Now, that one's not that dangerous, right. It's kind of annoying because you wish you knew that you had the antibodies and you can go out and do stuff.",00:37:45.360,00:37:39.390,Paul McCartney,795
802,"But you're not going to pass the disease on to, and you're going to pass the virus on to anyone else because you're going to think that you don't have the end the body. So you need to stay home.",00:37:53.400,00:37:45.600,Paul McCartney,796
803,"But there's a fourth option, a false positive, the test says you have the antibodies, but you don't",00:38:00.540,00:37:54.180,Paul McCartney,797
804,"And this is the really dangerous one. Because you're going to think that you're going to your immune, you're going to think you can't pass it on to anyone else. And you're going to go out into the wide world and pass it on.",00:38:10.230,00:38:00.990,Paul McCartney,798
805,"So the question is, how often does this happen. So let's let's look. Let's take a real scenario.",00:38:18.270,00:38:11.520,Paul McCartney,799
806,"5% of the population has coded 19 that's what the CDC meant when they said 5% prevalence, meaning that they 5% is had it and we'll test positive for it.",00:38:28.170,00:38:18.690,Paul McCartney,800
807,And the coven 19 antibody test is 95% accurate. So those are two assumptions and starting points. So let's say we have a population of thousand people. Let's say it's 1000 people at work.,00:38:39.150,00:38:28.710,Paul McCartney,801
808,So if there's 5% prevalence in the population 5% of these people have had coven and will test positive for it 5% of 1000 is 50 people so 50 people have antibodies and we'll test positive for tested its job.,00:38:54.150,00:38:40.020,Paul McCartney,802
809,"But the test is only 95% accurate meaning 5% of the time, it won't be accurate.",00:39:00.360,00:38:55.050,Paul McCartney,803
810,"So we will have a 5% false positive rate, people will falsely test positive, it will tell them that they have the antibodies, but they don't 5% of 1000 is again 50 so we have 50 people who will falsely test positive",00:39:15.930,00:39:00.840,Paul McCartney,804
811,"Now out of our thousand people all 100 of these people will test positive all 100 old test positive, but only 50 of them actually have it.",00:39:29.280,00:39:16.890,Paul McCartney,805
812,"Meaning there's only a 50% chance that you actually have the antibodies. So back to our original question of what is the chance to be an individual actually has the antibodies, assuming they test positive",00:39:42.240,00:39:30.060,Paul McCartney,806
813,50%. That's it. It's the same as a toss of a coin. So when we think that if we have the antibodies. We can go back out into the world.,00:39:51.210,00:39:43.230,Paul McCartney,807
814,"There's a 5050 chance that it won't work. Yes. Not all 1000 people get the test that is true, but we're going, we're basing this idea of antibody testing on that it will help us get back to work.",00:40:02.160,00:39:51.750,Paul McCartney,808
815,"And so we would test everyone in the population and how it, but people who test negative impact this style at all in general that number for this 95% accurate what they meant was 5% false positives and 5% false negatives. So there would also be a large issue with that as well.",00:40:19.710,00:40:02.580,Paul McCartney,809
816,Okey dokey.,00:40:22.680,00:40:21.870,Paul McCartney,810
817,"So, how we interpret the data, you know, CDC put out that statement, but how we interpret it as 95% accurate versus actually 5050 changes the entire way that we look at the situation.",00:40:35.310,00:40:24.750,Paul McCartney,811
818,So now we get to our final example of how and my favorite one finished baby boxes in 2013 the BBC put out this article Why finished babies sleep in cardboard boxes.,00:40:47.280,00:40:36.600,Paul McCartney,812
819,It was an article documenting the finished policy of giving every mother a cardboard box baby supplies and the baby would use the box as a bed.,00:40:56.430,00:40:47.760,Paul McCartney,813
820,"And this is a really interesting example of what happened because it exploded all over the place. People were talking about these baby boxes and for me, when my Molly, I will be right back to you. I'm going to write outside talk about that at the end.",00:41:10.020,00:40:57.300,Paul McCartney,814
821,But inside this article was a graph and it showed Finland's incredible decrease in infant mortality rate incredible progress from 1935 down here to 2010,00:41:23.460,00:41:11.790,Paul McCartney,815
822,"And it also included Finland's and current infant mortality rate which is two and 1000 versus the rest of the world, which is 32 and 1000",00:41:31.860,00:41:23.910,Paul McCartney,816
823,So really incredible based upon this policy of sending every mother a baby box.,00:41:38.100,00:41:32.340,Paul McCartney,817
824,"And it sparked an entire industry finished baby boxes British baby boxes. I actually went to a shower recently and the girl, my friend who was having a baby got two baby boxes at this whole industry.",00:41:51.930,00:41:38.730,Paul McCartney,818
825,And it's incredible really this box this cardboard box that can save a baby's life. It's not just any cardboard box. It's an $850 cardboard box.,00:42:01.980,00:41:52.380,Paul McCartney,819
826,"I'm not really sure what they print on that thing. But inside of it actually looks got one to look at it and I'm inside. It has six diapers, which I'm I think any parents would be able to decide how long six diapers last",00:42:14.130,00:42:02.610,Paul McCartney,820
827,"Like two one Z's. A couple books. So really, the, the whole thing is this cardboard box.",00:42:19.410,00:42:14.700,Paul McCartney,821
828,"Is your baby slept one baby slept in a dresser drawer exactly same concept but you know i i would admit I hope the dresser Jordan cost 800 bucks, but you never know.",00:42:28.830,00:42:20.760,Paul McCartney,822
829,"And so, but, you know, okay, if we really believed that this box would save your child's life would save any child's life, you'd say fine 800 bucks. No problem. You would do anything to get that box anything. So the question is, does it",00:42:46.680,00:42:29.670,Paul McCartney,823
830,Let's take a look back at this exact same graph and how we're going to interpret this data and how we're going to interpret this graph.,00:42:55.350,00:42:47.970,Paul McCartney,824
831,"In 1938 Finland had a higher infant mortality profile, then it's other Nordic neighbors and it decided it needed to do something about it.",00:43:04.290,00:42:55.890,Paul McCartney,825
832,"So it went on this incredible marketing campaign convincing others rich, poor educated or uneducated that they if they had their kids sleeping this baby box back kids slept in it they be fine. They'd survive, but this would save their child's life.",00:43:23.040,00:43:04.680,Paul McCartney,826
833,"And when every mother was convinced of this and wanted this baby box. The finished government said, you know, there's actually a catch.",00:43:33.300,00:43:24.300,Paul McCartney,827
834,"In order to get this baby box every mother will get one, but you have to go to prenatal education class.",00:43:41.190,00:43:33.990,Paul McCartney,828
835,So in 1944 the year before the box came out 31% finished and others receive Prenatal Education in 1945 the year after 86% of finished mothers received Prenatal Education. It wasn't the box at all. It was education and general progress of info mortality rates across the world.,00:44:02.010,00:43:42.090,Paul McCartney,829
836,"And the reason we know this is because the infant mortality profile for rich, poor educated and uneducated finished mothers.",00:44:09.630,00:44:03.090,Paul McCartney,830
837,"Is the same as the infant mortality profile for rich and educated mothers in the US, the difference is born on educated mothers in the US have a much higher infant mortality profile. Now you can forgive industry for",00:44:24.420,00:44:09.900,Paul McCartney,831
838,"You know, deciding to profit and go, go forth and conquer off of these finished baby boxes.",00:44:30.330,00:44:25.440,Paul McCartney,832
839,But you would think governments and other governments would sort of look into this sort of how this these baby boxes really worked before embarking upon a scheme.,00:44:40.290,00:44:31.170,Paul McCartney,833
840,To send out baby boxes but no in a baby boxes were sent out in Essex in Birmingham and Scotland. They piloted a program in 2016 and now every single mother and Scotland receives a baby box. No. Prenatal Education required to the tune of I think $13 million of taxpayer money.,00:44:59.820,00:44:40.590,Paul McCartney,834
841,"But you know, that's the UK. We're America or smarter our government would definitely look into this stuff before piloting these baby boxes.",00:45:07.800,00:45:01.020,Paul McCartney,835
842,"Except they don't US states introduced baby boxes to help combat infant mortality in 2017 Alabama New Jersey and Ohio sent out baby boxes to the tune of 15,000,020 6,000,030 $5 million tons and tons of taxpayer money wasted with no Prenatal Education required",00:45:30.630,00:45:08.160,Paul McCartney,836
843,"And if someone had simply asked how is this interpreted. How does, what does this graph really mean we wouldn't be here.",00:45:40.050,00:45:32.160,Paul McCartney,837
844,"And as Alonso asks, How do you get to think to all the questions that are not intuitive to the data presented",00:45:46.470,00:45:40.530,Paul McCartney,838
845,"I know these questions seems stupid who what and how but I am telling you they work if you just take a step back and think, Who is this data about",00:45:57.210,00:45:46.950,Paul McCartney,839
846,"What are we really trying to ask of it and how should we really be interpreting this, it may not give you the answers. It may not make us. It's not going to make you a statistician",00:46:07.650,00:45:57.540,Paul McCartney,840
847,But it will give you a feeling for whether the veracity of this data really need something,00:46:12.990,00:46:07.980,Paul McCartney,841
848,"And this this example leads us to our fourth question of why, why do we care and I want to, I want to use the same baby box numbers. And I want to say, you know,",00:46:24.870,00:46:13.860,Paul McCartney,842
849,"I don't know the difference between 26,000,035 million except that it's 9 million",00:46:29.640,00:46:25.350,Paul McCartney,843
850,"These numbers don't mean anything to me and our jobs and our work and newspapers, we see these numbers. Every time we see billions. We see trillions.",00:46:37.680,00:46:29.940,Paul McCartney,844
851,"For a lot of states 15,000,035. These are rounding errors for states for companies. How do we have a we make these numbers mean something. Why should we care about this money that's lost",00:46:50.130,00:46:37.890,Paul McCartney,845
852,And I would say that going along the lines of anyone looking at this would be interested in sort of Child Health and baby health that we somehow figure out a way to make those numbers mean something in terms of that in terms of their opportunity cost as Mandy says,00:47:04.800,00:46:51.030,Paul McCartney,846
853,"So how do we do that, I would say, then instead of saying that Alabama wasted $15 million of taxpayer money.",00:47:12.210,00:47:05.340,Paul McCartney,847
854,"They could have paid for diapers for a year for 30,000 babies or New Jersey could have bought baby food for a year for 40,000 babies or Ohio could have paid a year salary for 800 new child social care workers.",00:47:29.580,00:47:12.600,Paul McCartney,848
855,We need to turn these numbers into something that matters to people into something that people understand and personally matters to them.,00:47:39.180,00:47:29.880,Paul McCartney,849
856,And that brings me to our last example you know we've talked this whole time about negative things you know the right you know,00:47:46.860,00:47:40.110,Paul McCartney,850
857,"About the, you know, all the manipulative things bad things sneaky things. But there's also incredible things that we can do. There's really incredible things we can do with actually making people care about the numbers.",00:48:00.000,00:47:47.130,Paul McCartney,851
858,"Or in the most severe refugee crisis since world war two and it's only growing UNHCR, the UN Refugee agencies budget for 2016 was $8",00:48:09.240,00:48:00.810,Paul McCartney,852
859,"Billion, but they only got 3 billion. That's $5 billion needed to help people. So what do they do they need to figure out a way to raise more money.",00:48:18.090,00:48:09.690,Paul McCartney,853
860,"That is, but as what needs to be done for this refugee crisis. So how do they do it, and I'm going to show you a very disturbing image. Next, so please. Just be ready for that.",00:48:27.030,00:48:18.540,Paul McCartney,854
861,This is Alan Curtis. He's a three year old Syrian boy who in 2015 was found drowned on a Turkish beach and his family were Syrian refugees fleeing to Europe.,00:48:37.920,00:48:28.560,Paul McCartney,855
862,"This pictures unfathomably horrible event is really what sparked the world's discussion of the Syrian refugee crisis and one would imagine. I mean, how could you not look at that photo and feel sort of a deep on unbelievable sadness and it did increase donations, but not for very long.",00:48:59.640,00:48:38.550,Paul McCartney,856
863,"Three days was how long this image stayed in people's minds. There's absolutely horrible, horrible tragedy, and it was three days that a picture was able to see stay in people's minds.",00:49:12.330,00:49:00.840,Paul McCartney,857
864,"So we decided that we need to figure out what does stay in people's minds what works, what makes them care about the crisis or the issue longer",00:49:22.110,00:49:12.780,Paul McCartney,858
865,"So we did a study and what works and what doesn't. So we call people and we ask them questions and you say, which one of these does this increase or decrease your affinity towards the crisis.",00:49:35.160,00:49:22.920,Paul McCartney,859
866,"So if someone asks you, refugees undergo stringent security checks. Would that make you feel better about refugees or worse and take a second and think what you think most people would feel",00:49:45.390,00:49:35.760,Paul McCartney,860
867,"This question surprised me. It actually decreased people's affinity for the cause, because it reminded them that there are security issues.",00:49:55.260,00:49:47.700,Paul McCartney,861
868,Refugees more likely to graduate college and secure jobs than non refugees.,00:50:01.080,00:49:56.310,Paul McCartney,862
869,Is that going to increase or decrease people support in this case that decreased Democratic support but increased Republican support.,00:50:09.390,00:50:02.220,Paul McCartney,863
870,Nearly half of refugees or children.,00:50:12.450,00:50:10.530,Paul McCartney,864
871,Increased all support Albert Einstein was a refugee think it increased or decreased support it increased all support. We did a test on Catholics.,00:50:23.610,00:50:13.650,Paul McCartney,865
872,"60 million to displace 21 million refugees are fleeing their homes and then we had another one that said, Jesus was a refugee, the numbers had no change in support. Jesus was a refugee had an large increase",00:50:37.980,00:50:24.240,Paul McCartney,866
873,What this told us is that if you say there is a global refugee crisis. They're 16 million displaced. No one cares right these are fleeting numbers. They mean nothing to us and it goes right out of our head.,00:50:50.760,00:50:38.430,Paul McCartney,867
874,"But if we can take the numbers and have them say this is the way it impacts you and what you care about people will become donors, people are affected, and they will remember",00:51:02.250,00:50:51.390,Paul McCartney,868
875,"So we did a campaign during the major league baseball playoffs for each team that you would be watching, we put up their stadium and the number of people.",00:51:11.820,00:51:03.450,Paul McCartney,869
876,"42,000 new people flee their homes on a daily basis. This is the same size as the crowd that you are watching on TV and this case at the Minute Maid Park, home of the Houston Astros",00:51:23.820,00:51:12.060,Paul McCartney,870
877,"It let us take this big number 42,000 people flee their home every day. That means nothing to anyone.",00:51:31.050,00:51:24.450,Paul McCartney,871
878,"And give it a visual from something that people care about, they are watching this stadium, they are watching this crowd. They can see all these people",00:51:41.040,00:51:31.680,Paul McCartney,872
879,"And it meant something it increase donations by 100,000 recurring donors. People, who keep giving",00:51:49.590,00:51:41.550,Paul McCartney,873
880,"If you are able to tell good numerical stories. If you're able to not just take the data analysis, but actually show the why, why we should care about it and make it mean something to people.",00:52:03.900,00:51:50.580,Paul McCartney,874
881,"Then, whether it's for engagement action donation customers whatever you're trying to do. If those numbers can impact someone personally, you can have a lasting decision for them.",00:52:16.320,00:52:04.200,Paul McCartney,875
882,"Really overall what this says is, we come back to data ism and humanism, you know, data gives us incredible insights to things. We'd never be able to see, but we need to retain our own experience and our own tuition.",00:52:33.090,00:52:19.770,Paul McCartney,876
883,"And make sure that we were always asking the right questions of the data. The who the what the how and the, why should we care. And if we're able to do that then we really can deliver true value in both our personal and working moms. Thank you.",00:52:49.770,00:52:33.390,Paul McCartney,877
884,"Thank you very much liberty for sharing such a helpful way of thinking about numbers and I was wondering, in a couple minutes that we have. If you have any",00:53:02.130,00:52:52.410,Andrew Knight,878
885,"Like rules of thumb or your risks that you use when you're reading a news article or, you know, the latest piece of information that comes out about coven.
